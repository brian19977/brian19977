                    Open Letters: In Response to "The Case Against College Admissions Counselors"
                </p><p>
                    [Original article <a href="https://time.com/6237286/private-college-counselors-gatekeepers/">here</a>, retrieved 4 Dec. 2022]
                </p><p>
                    Dear Mr. Mandery,
                </p><p>
                    I read your article in Time magazine titled "The Case Against Private Counselors" recently, and
                    thank you for taking the time to bring some light to a significant subsystem of the college
                    admissions process.
                </p><p>
                    However, I found the article smudging evidence to support the argument or going long on rhetoric
                    when data was lacking. For one example, you wrote that "private counselors offer bespoke, white
                    glove services, including assistance in constructing the sort of extraordinary extracurricular
                    opportunities that catch the eye of admissions officers" -- but how many of the 8,000 full-time
                    private counselors offer services like researcher-matching or other truly excessive services?
                    How many students purchase those services? In my experience -- attending Regis, the private,
                    competitively-admitting school in Manhattan's Upper East Side -- even those who have consultants
                    lean more toward choosing their extracurricular activities rather than nepotizing or buying their
                    way into them.
                </p><p>
                    In another example, the sociologist AJ Alvero said to you that "I don’t think it’s possible to
                    imagine a universe in which some of those students didn’t have help with their essays." You
                    later suggest a disclosure form for students to sign if they receive assistance. But anyone with
                    kids -- and you seem to have three, based on your Wikipedia page -- knows that kids will lie to
                    get ahead or avoid trouble. If they didn't, colleges wouldn't be having an epidemic of cheating.
                    But the more fundamental problem is how shallow this disclosure is. Is receiving assistance from
                    English teachers, guidance counselors, or relatives OK, or must that be disclosed too? If we only
                    disclose "paid" services only, as I predict you may reply, it would skew the balance even more
                    toward the well-off, as the white, well-educated, urbane English teachers, guidance counselors,
                    and relatives of already-privileged youth would allow said youth to check "no" honestly, while the
                    Asians and minorities who might pay $30-60 to get essay editing from an online service (in my
                    anecdotal experience, far more common than any bespoke multi-thousand-dollar package) would be
                    further disadvantaged or compelled to lie. A sit-down exam likewise would disadvantage those
                    who don't grow up using high-quality Standard Written English in daily life, and would likely
                    end up with the same disparate impacts as the SAT.
                </p><p>
                    The contextless mention of a consultancy charging $1.5 million strikes me as especially egregious.
                    A cherry-picked example of the sort I was taught in 9th-grade debate to call out is being indulged
                    in by a Harvard College and -Law grad (which you conveniently omit in your column). My bias against
                    the New York Post aside, if you would contextualize how many students, in all of America, receive
                    this service, I imagine it would make your point weaker: "Yes, there is this egregious purchasing
                    ... but only fifty households nationwide did it."
                </p><p> 
                    The problem is deep, but categorically demolishing college guidance counselors as vultures of
                    high-school student anxiety is beneath you. I look forward to reading "Poison Ivy" -- I'm sure
                    there's as much about my alma mater, Columbia, as yours.
                </p><p>
                    Respectfully your small-time college essay consultant,
                </p><p>
                    Brian Paick.
                </p><p>
                    P.S. In 1940, Harvard may have admitted 80% of students -- but only because (1) it probably didn't
                    occur to the majority of Americans even to apply (or they weren't even considered [read:
                    antisemitism]) and (2) it wasn't so mythologized or (rightly) seen as a gatekeeper of prosperity.
                    The sharp reduction in admission rates speaks just as much to the widening horizons of possibility
                    for thousands of students as the ease of application under the Common App.
                </p>

                    UPDATE: Evan Mandery's response, quoted <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span> (omitting 
                    identifying information in email signature):
                </p><p>
                    Just acknowledging receipt of this. I discuss my own background and experiences quite extensively
                    in my book. I think your argument suffers from many of the same flaws you identify in my own, but
                    everyone will see it as they see it.
                </p><p>
                    Take care.
                </p><p>

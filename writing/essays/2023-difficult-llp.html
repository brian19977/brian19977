                    "It's about being a warrior. It doesn't matter about the cause necessarily. This is your path and

                    One of my main gripes with my current job is that I don't find it sufficiently challenging. My
                    frustrations with the work are almost always technical (limitations of the platform or software
                    being used), interpersonal (slothful responses to requests for clarification or delivery of a
                    piece of code), or transgressional (being told to perform a task obviously the requestor's responsibility).
                    In fact, the times which I've enjoyed my work the most are occasions when the work was challenging: when
                    I have to read thousands of lines of code to understand a piece of software, design a nontrivial
                    enhancement or augmentation of it, and then write error-free, performant, and elegant code.
                </p><p>
                    This is a common complaint among my intimates, who, with few exceptions, are frustrated chiefly
                    by aspects of their work besides its degree of challenge: my partner who wrote a forty-page essay
                    on operatic adaptations of <span style="font-style: italic;">Othello</span>, now generating book
                    contracts and negotiating advances; my economics-major friend who suffered through advanced microeconomics
                    and modern analysis,<sup>[<a id="en1src" href="#en1">1</a>]</sup> now working fourteen-hour days manipulating
                    Excel files; my computer-science friend who did natural language processing research with an eminence in the
                    field, for a while working as a Tennessee unemployment agency call center representative (long story).
                </p><p>
                    School is often the time to push oneself to one's limit—a relatively controlled environment where,
                    in the words of one of my favorite teachers, "the worst you can do is fail." Surrounded (hopefully)
                    by bright peers and presented with opportunities to pursue great, interesting, or at least hard
                    things, the engaged student at least makes an honest go at some of them.
                </p><p>
                    But the attitude tends not to last: at work, challenges have higher stakes, it's tempting and often
                    acceptable to coast, and one probably won't be recognized for it even if it goes well. It's even more
                    improbable that one push oneself in hobbies or leisure: we do them for fun, after all, and who's going
                    to sit down, cup of tea steaming and pen in hand, to <span style="font-style: italic;">The Brothers Karamazov</span>—after
                    work?<sup>[<a id="en2src" href="#en2">2</a>]</sup>
                </p><p>
                    Why bother?
                </p><p> 
                    It really is a bother, a lot of the time. And entertainment is so plentiful and accessible—overwhelmingly so—that
                    reading serious literature or cooking complex dishes or writing essays for nothing other than personal
                    satisfaction can seem like a niche form of masochism.
                </p><p>
                    But we lose something when we don't do challenging things. We soften, we care less; we become satisfied with "enough"—entertaining
                    enough, interesting enough, fulfilling enough. And this softening is pernicious not only because it circumscribes our expectations,
                    of others and ourselves, but also because it limits our very conception of the possible in our lives. 
                </p><p>
                    We who forget the feeling of prolonged frustration also forget the miraculous release when the problem is solved or
                    the goal is attained; we who haven't experienced prolonged frustration since our schooldays more easily bail when
                    confronted with it in the preliminary stages of planning a move abroad or a career change. We lose the capacity to
                    imagine starting a business, or hiking the Camino de Santiago, or going back to school—there are bills to pay, the
                    bucket list is already yea long, it's just so … much … work.
                </p><p>
                    So, I believe the habit of putting oneself, even occasionally, in the discomfort zone—of investing time, money, and emotions;
                    of pulling hair and losing sleep; of trying and risking failure—is not only a worthwhile part of, but essential to human flourishing.
                    Whatever one's choice of discomfort and challenge be, the importance lies in pursuing it, and feeling it, and relishing it—not to do
                    so would be a death-in-life, a living death.
                </p><p>
                    This is a deeply luxurious notion: plenty of people's lives are plenty, <span style="font-style: italic;">plenty</span> challenging
                    in ways I can't even imagine.<sup>[<a id="en3src" href="#en3">3</a>]</sup> Their struggle deserves and has my unbounded respect,
                    and I am not writing for those individuals. I'm writing for my friends—and myself: we who treat our entry-level software engineering
                    jobs as sinecures; we who spend way too much time absorbing social media (or the media); we who once waged wars on Turing machines and
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">The Canterbury Tales</span> and Francis Fukuyama, but have forgotten how to be warriors. To them—us—I say:

                <p>

                    than any book of the last thirty years is employed to signal erudition and worldliness. But those who have dared plunge into its depths likely

                    The Hardest Music I've Performed: Sonata, op. 1 by Alban Berg
                </p><p>
                    The composer Alban Berg studied with Arnold Schoenberg, the father of musical atonality, for six years; he wrote his only
                    piano sonata as his graduation piece. It is twelve minutes of miasmic, saccharine melodies, chords wandering all over the
                    harmonic map, and sublime climaxes which strike the listener as both near-incomprehensible and deeply moving, like some
                    cosmic phenomenon, fearful and radiant.
                </p><p>
                    With piano technique never particularly good, the Sonata would have been a stretch goal for my lifetime; I undertook to
                    learn and perform it amidst a full slate of academic and extracurricular responsibilities. It defied my typical approach
                    of reading the score, honing the sections, and playing it from beginning to end; there was just too much, and too much
                    I didn't understand. The Sonata was the first piece for which I read academic articles in preparation, and the only piece 
                    whose score I studied as much at a desk as at the piano.
                </p><p>
                    Though there will always be pieces I will simply be incapable of performing for lack of an authoritarian piano teacher in
                    my childhood (a fact for which I am eternally grateful), the Berg Sonata taught me not to be afraid of any music: any music
                    of beauty and pathos—that is, any music worth playing—would, and is meant to, open up to the devoted musician and the human
                    listener.

                </p><p>
                    Many of my friends know I was taking this class because it was pretty much all I could talk about for a few months—a question
                    as anodyne as "How have you been?" was, to my brain, an open invitation to complain about such esoteric topics as signal
                    handling and filesystem paging. (I am surprised and, frankly, a touch disappointed that none of them told me to stop
                    talking about it.)
                </p><p>
                    The reviews above are accurate—never before had it taken me an hour to understand a single line of code; never before had
                    I had seventy tabs open trying to understand what my program was doing; never before had I, in fact, flat out given up on
                    a homework assignment. But this class, more than anything else I've ever done, taught me to do hard things. It taught me
                    to bang my head against the wall until the wall broke (long after my head had, of course). It taught me to press "run
                    program" even when it was almost guaranteed that my program would crash my computer. It taught me not to be afraid—or,
                    even when I was afraid, to keep going.

                    The Hardest Writing I've Produced: "The Plain"
                </p><p>
                    "The Plain" is a demonstrably bad Cormac McCarthy mimesis I wrote, inspired in equal parts by <span style="font-style: italic;">Blood Meridian</span> and
                    Alexander Scriabin's Piano Sonata no. 7, "White Mass." The former concerns a band of scalphunters in the 1850s Southwest,
                    spreading oblivion and bloodshed wherever they go; the latter is a blindingly ecstatic work written as an exorcism, replete
                    with the mystic harmonies characteristic of the composer.
                </p><p>
                    I conjured a supernatural short story, incorporating McCarthy's amoral violence and quoting the sonata's expressive markings
                    ("Mysteriously sonorous," "With a dark majesty"), about phantoms who offered humans the choice of losing their souls and themselves
                    becoming phantoms or being slaughtered. But it ended up being filled with churning, inelegant prose like
                </p><p class="blockquote">

                    and celebrated and reveled in the virgin earth to violate and impure. They would scatter—soulless vectors unwavering and
                    unerring and bearing down upon their forsaken objects.

                    One phantom took a worn path leading from the plain and came upon a scattering of souls in tents. With night long since having
                    fallen they rested not knowing of the disturbance in the world and under these umbers the phantom swept its embers of eyes over
                    its awaited victims. It adapted anthropic form and stamped its foot—a mighty sound but dull in resonance—which drew the humans
                    from their tents. They looked upon an unassuming man—slight in frame and limpid in bulk—with his hands clasped behind his back.

                    It was, I daresay, a valiant attempt to imitate one of our most inimitable writers. It is too unpolished and too clumsy to be

                </p><p>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Honeybees and Thunder</span> is a novel by the Japanese writer Riku Onda, about a piano
                    competition and its contestants. For a classical piano lover like myself, the book was pure pleasure to read: an exploration
                    of obscure aspects of the classical music industry, characters ranging from a prodigal god-child to a salaryman returning to
                    music in adulthood, and so many of my favorite pieces described so eloquently. But it was in Korean, with no English translation,
                    and I wanted to share it with my friends, so I decided—without thinking too hard about it—that I would translate it.
                </p><p>
                    Two years, seven hundred pages, and well over one hundred thousand words later, I was done. As someone whose main use of his
                    mother tongue was to ask what dinner was going to be, the challenge of actually understanding each word and nuance, translating
                    page after page, and creating a coherent, consistent whole almost defeated me, more than once. My partner, to whom I promised
                    the complete book as a gift, said after I finished that she had not actually expected for me to finish it.
                </p><p>
                    What started out as an exercise in Korean ended up as a testament either to my stubbornness or dedication; I am glad to be done,
                    and I am glad that I finished. It's no great work of art, but it's mine, and I'm prouder of that than I can say.

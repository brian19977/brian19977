                </p><p>
	                Great concerts of classical music are often noted by their performer, city, and year: Pogorelich,
                    Naples 1994; Abbado, Lucerne 2010; Cho/Nézet-Séguin, New York 2022. Some concerts are so (in)famous
                    that the performer is dropped: if one mentions "that New York 1962 concert," what might be being discussed other than Glenn
                    Gould's (for he undoubtedly owned, if not outright subjugated, it) Concerto in D Minor by Brahms
                    with Leonard Bernstein? But a piano recital of infrequent note stands in my mind as the greatest
                    concert ever put to record: Grigory Sokolov in Madrid, 1998.<sup>[<a id="en1src" href="#en1">1</a>]</sup>
                </p><p>
                	A few words on Sokolov. He has often been described as a recluse—few studio recordings, zero concerto
                    appearances since the mid-aughts, a press kit thinner than the program books at his recitals—but
                    reclusive a man who gives seventy concerts a year is not. He is known for his near-obsessive study,
                    not only of the music he plays, but the instruments: hours selecting, tuning, and otherwise adjusting
                    pianos before every recital; he is the only pianist permanently retained by Steinway to consult on
                    modifications to their pianos' design. But, beyond these facts, his music—from the Renaissance to 
                    the contemporary, available mostly as bootlegs from a half-century of recitals—is transcendent beyond
                    dispute; he is one of few pianists whose music I can identify from the moment it is playing as
                    irrevocably theirs. (The aforementioned Gould, and perhaps Sviatoslav Richter, are also among them.)
                </p><p>
	                Returning to the concert. The program is an ambitious, and peculiar one: Rameau's Suite in G;
                    Beethoven's Sonata no. 16, op. 31 no. 1; Brahms's Sonata no. 1, op. 1. The three contrasting
                    pieces—an arch-baroque suite of endless ornaments and counterpoint; a humorous, rarely-played
                    sonata whose challenge lies in making its simplicity interesting; and a colossal, virtuosic
                    sonata by a Brahms known then more for his bombast than for his sensitivity—are all roughly
                    thirty minutes, meaning that one half of the concert would be considerably longer than the
                    other, taxing both performer and listener. But Sokolov—then and now, without much doubt the
                    greatest pianist alive—pulled them together into the greatest evening of music ever had.
                </p><p>
                    When I first heard the recording, I could not quite believe what I was hearing: from the very
                    first bars of the Rameau, Sokolov seemed to have conjured the audience into some eighteenth-century
                    French <span style="font-style: italic;">salon</span>. The timbre of the piano is shall we say
                    much different from the harpsichord; the piano's resonance, especially with the pedal, is often
                    described, favorably, as lush, colorful, and rich. But I say with the highest praise that the
                    suite was bone-dry, brittle to breaking: without any pedal, and with almost every note staccato,
                    he achieved a timbre almost unthinkable on the piano. Many instructors encourage pupils to
                    achieve a "crispiness" in their ornaments; Sokolov's would have broken on touch. It's not to
                    say the music wasn't rich, or wasn't colorful, as called for, but its magic lay in that marvelous
                    Baroque tang, those perfect little rolled-r—<span style="font-style: italic;">arrrrrrrr</span>—trills.
                </p><p>
                    The Beethoven—what is there to say? It was a non-stop comic opera. The Sonata no. 16 has been
                    characterized as the funniest of Beethoven's sonatas—one writer describes its humor as ranging
                    from "the subtle to the ironically crass"—and Sokolov drew on its reserves of jollity from the
                    very first note to the last. A slower-than-usual tempo (a common aspect of Sokolov's music)
                    amplified the slapstick first movement's incongruities, and yet I'd never heard it at the
                    same time so tender. The second movement, evoking a duet between some Leporello-esque
                    servant and a high-strung, preening soprano, was perfectly executed, with a stolid bass
                    and flitty, meandering <span style="font-style: italic;">ad libitum</span> passages. The third movement was a breathless romp,
                    with disarming dynamic and tempo changes, perfectly conjuring some faux-deep comedy
                    that can't help but sneak in a sex joke in the last line. It was perfect.
                </p><p>
                    The Brahms Sonata may be the oddest choice: Brahms wrote his three piano sonatas,
                    opp. 1, 2, and 5, early in his career (opus numbers usually progress as a composer
                    ages, and Brahms reached op. 122), and the first is in many ways the most overblown,
                    the most earnest, and the least pianistic. But Sokolov pushed these elements to the
                    fore, and in the process created a music of nearly orchestral sweep, clarity, and force.
                    A cadre of pianists, mostly bygone and mostly Russian—Horowitz, Pletnev, Gilels—is known
                    for a "big" sound, not merely loud but heavy, somehow magisterial in their heft; Sokolov,
                    with this sonata, proved his place among them. Never has a simple C Major chord rung
                    with such power.
                </p><p>
                    Sokolov pushed the evening to a solid two hours of music with three encores of diverse
                    origin—more Brahms, some Chopin, and Debussy—and retreated at the end of it all, walking
                    before completing his bow, like some prophet who, having given his dispensation, evaporated
                    wordlessly for the mere mortals to contemplate his gift. What I would give to have been present.

                    Dearest—
                </p><p>
        	        Do you remember the first day we met?
                </p><p>
        	        You were old enough to remember, I think, but I know you've tried to forget about those early
                    years. Eight years old, clutching a stuffed rabbit as though God himself had told you to protect
                    it. And why wouldn't you. You thought then that nothing you had, you could keep.
                </p><p>
                    All the other kids that day followed our every movement with twinkling eyes, some craning their
                    necks to keep us in sight, others tiptoeing, everyone smiling. I found it nauseating—that you
                    were all so eager to be chosen, all made to stand there, all in an orphanage to begin with.
                    You, though—you scorned us, ignoring the whispers we were exchanging, fixating on that rabbit's
                    left ear, looking down until we were right in front of you, and then suddenly staring straight
                    into our eyes: what do you think you're looking at.
                </p><p>
        	        I'd like to say I knew, but of course I didn't. Love at first sight applies only to handbags
                    and paintings. I hope you don't take that as a rebuke.
                </p><p>
                    Right now, you're sleeping in the extra bedroom, just a bit down the hall. How glad I am to
                    have you with me. It's hard to believe that the last time you were so close, you were just
                    barely grown—still growing, in too many ways, to leave. How I've missed you.
                </p><p>
        	        I wanted to ask you a million questions as soon as I saw you through the window last night.
                    In that moment, I wanted to break down the door—undoing the bolts would take too long.
                    I didn't even feel the blast of icy wind blowing off the lake when I let you in. I didn't
                    feel it because you looked at me, almost unrecognizable in the sunkenness of your eyes and
                    the frailness of your frame. Half of me wanted to sweep you into my arms; half of me wanted
                    to collapse and weep.
                </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
                </p><p>
                    I laugh, but I also weep, when I think of our first years together. How we loved you; how you
                    loathed us.
                </p><p>
                    No, you can't eat from the serving bowl. No, you can't eat while watching TV. Yes, you have
                    to go to school, and no, you can't wear that awful leather jacket. Yes, you have to sleep by
                    ten. Yes, all of the salad. No, never go potty in the bathtub again. No, of course we won't
                    send you back.
                </p><p>
                    When was the turning point? Was it when I pulled you away from the rattlesnake during our
                    camping trip in the desert? Was it when she stayed home with you for a week as you threw up
                    on every piece of furniture we owned? Was it when we flipped off your principal and let you
                    switch to a new school after learning the truth about that awful teacher?
                </p><p>
                    Was there one? 
                </p><p>
                    I have too many questions, too many what-ifs, too many should-haves. How they plague me
                    now, those rabbit holes and dead ends. But you're here now.
                </p><p>
                    When I awoke, you weren't in the house, but you had left a note. To be honest, I was
                    surprised that you had even done that. I guess I at least had the sense not to let my
                    guard down. That makes me sad, though. That I couldn't let my guard down around my own.
                    You deserve better. To have been better supported. Better cared for. Better loved.
                </p><p>
                    After only a night, your traces have livened up the house. Your coat lies draped over
                    the couch. Your duffel, which smells bad, is open at the foot of your bed. Coffee
                    beans oxidize on the countertop; the remains of your latte congeal at the bottom
                    of her favorite mug. That alone is enough to floor me; you had to use that one,
                    didn't you.
                </p><p>
                    Do I believe you're out running? Sure. I hope you're enjoying yourself. I guess
                    I could use a little solitude myself—one last morning alone, which brings me
                    to something like four thousand. The counting doesn't even hurt anymore.
                    Does cutting into scar tissue hurt? When the—
                </p><p>
                    I'm sorry. Poor choice of imagery.
                </p><p>
                    What do I have to say to you? What could I even say to you? Will you say
                    something to me? Why did you come back? What made you come back? Will you
                    stay?
                </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
                </p><p>
                    Of course I blame myself. And of course you blame me. Why shouldn't you?
                </p><p>
                    All of it was my idea, after all. The mountain. The training regimen I
                    planned and then didn't do. The refusing to cancel even though I was a
                    little under the weather. The pressing on despite a chance—a low chance,
                    but a chance—of storms.
                </p><p>
                    In fact, the only thing that wasn't my idea was her giving me her oxygen.
                </p><p>
                    When we were airlifted off the side of that cliff, I already knew I was
                    going to lose some toes. Whatever, I thought. As long as she gets back
                    down. But instead, miraculously, I kept my toes, and she—
                </p><p>
                    Her last words, barely audible: "I'm tired."
                </p><p>
                    I'd never heard her say that before.
                </p><p>
                    You didn't say a word to me when we got back. You were too busy hating me,
                    your glare as intense as it was on that gray morning when we first met you.
                </p><p>
                    You knew more than most—that the trip was my idea, that she was the only
                    one sticking with the workouts. But she knew about my fever and the storms.
                    And now you do too.
                </p><p>
                    If for some reason you'd decided to stay, I wouldn't be surprised to see
                    you change your mind after reading this.
                </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
                </p><p>
                    You were in fact out on a run. And we ate the stew I had made a few days
                    ago together—the first meal we've shared in, well, too long. Somehow, for
                    all of the questions smothering me last night and this morning—one bled
                    into the next—I couldn't think of any way to begin. You ate silently too.
                    Did you not know how to start either? Did you not want to? Did you have
                    nothing to say?
                </p><p>
                    You've shut yourself in the room for hours now, and I've been at the desk,
                    writing this. I can't remember the last time I wrote anything longer than
                    a grocery list. People said it would be helpful to write, to reflect. But
                    I would have started and stopped at: I killed the love of my life. 
                </p><p>
                    When we first were getting to know each other, I'd often tell her that
                    I'd be the end of us. She would shake her head and frown, casting aside
                    my worries as ridiculous. And then I couldn't help but laugh myself,
                    and she would follow suit. 
                </p><p>
                    How she laughed, or joked, or poked fun, or cheered, or smiled. How alive
                    she was, in every sense of that cruel word.
                </p><p>
                    Sometimes I feel as though I'm an insult to her death, and to her life.
                    You don't have to be deceased to be dead. Or aged to be old. You only
                    need to be thoughtless, lifeless, loveless. How I've squandered my second
                    chance. Perhaps it's because I haven't been thinking of this time as a
                    second chance, but as a punishment. Consigned to grayness until time
                    finally shows me mercy.
                </p><p>
                    I daren't kill myself, of course. I think that's the only thing I could
                    do that's worse than what I've already done.
                </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
                </p><p>
                    Oh, oh, oh. How I wish you didn't forgive me.
                </p><p>
                    Rather. How I wish you hadn't lived what you lived. Would that you'd lived
                    in hatred of me than in empathy with me. Your story could make a stone weep. 
                </p><p>
                    After you left, I told close family and friends, but refused their urges to
                    report you missing. Because you weren't missing. Not really. Absent, but not
                    missing. You're smart, and I figured you'd simply realized that you were
                    better off without me.
                </p><p>
                    And you went off and discovered heroin to be the only thing that let you sleep
                    at night. And you did whatever you needed for that little bit of warmth, a
                    neurochemical semblance of her support, her embrace, her love. And you lived
                    that way for years, until you found someone who, for the first time since her,
                    gave you that warmth while not destroying your body. And you loved for the first
                    time since her. And you two decided to get clean, but not before one last high.
                </p><p>
                    And now you have returned, bearing your guilt and knowing my pain.
                </p><p>
                    You've grown up, and I've grown old. We're both too old for our ages, though.
                    Too old for such fatigue, such grief, such grayness.
                </p><p>
                    I still mean it, though. For all of our suffering, or perhaps because of it,
                    I want to know. How do you feel about me, do you still love her, are you going
                    to stay. Is this our second—my third—chance? I can tell you how I feel, at least. 
                </p><p>
                    You are not mine. You have not given yourself to me, nor do I think I deserve you.
                    Few parents feel they deserve their children, though. I cannot help but go back to
                    our first meeting, and then on to our first few years and their growing pains, our
                    maturity, our separation, our—reunion? reconciliation? whatever this is. I stepped
                    into your room briefly after lunch, to watch you nap. Your brow was relaxed; your
                    breathing was even. I admit, it's a little disquieting to have someone else in the
                    house—nothing I own feels like mine, not "my house"—after so long alone. But you're
                    back, fast asleep, and I feel that we're starting again: you eight years old, me
                    filled with optimism. We're worse off than we were, but we have the rest of our
                    lives now.
                </p><p>
                    Friends and family have drifted away, mostly. I wasn't unkind to them—at least I
                    hope they don't feel that way. But I was closed-off, unable to receive their
                    warmth, preferring to sleepwalk through my days than to be awoken by the pain
                    of moving on. And after a few years, they mercifully stopped trying. We should
                    call them together, maybe this afternoon.
                </p><p>
                    I've little else left to write to you. I hope we can live the rest of what I
                    would say. We in old age still have our life and our love. We can't make up
                    the missing time, but we can catch each other up, and then we can move forward.
                </p><p>
                    I wish I could have met your love. Mine was incandescent, exuberant, the most
                    beautiful person imaginable. I don't doubt for a second that I would have loved
                    your love, too.
                </p><p>
                    This is going to take some practice. I'm sorry that I still haven't figured
                    out how to love, but I love you. I miss her every day, and I'm sure you do
                    too. I'm glad you're back.
                </p><p>

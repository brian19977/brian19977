                    Letter of Recommendation: Reading in Subways
                </p><p>
	                The transportation system is often the most maligned and the most widely used governmental agency of any
                    major metropolis. For us New Yorkers, this part of our geographical identity becomes even more pronounced:
                    our pride in the Apple derives not just from having the most extensive commuter rail system in the nation
                    but also from braving its intimidating, filthy, delay-riddled bowels day in and day out. But future retellings
                    of the high school years spent traversing the depths of New York will likely be accompanied not by the sighs
                    such stories typically evoke but by laughs, as befit some of my fondest memories of city life.
                </p><p>
                	My love affair with subways coincided with the start of high school. As a Harlemite, commuting to the Upper
                    East Side is less difficult than it is for my friends who come in from the far-flung reaches of Central New
                    Jersey or Upstate New York. Nevertheless, for the first few weeks of freshman year, I struggled to adjust to
                    the high doses of public transportation—express trains thundering through the station and battering my
                    eardrums; homeless men rattling their cups of change while I, fearing eye contact, averted my gaze; body
                    odor assaulting my olfactory glands as I heaved inside enclosed, AC-less subway cars in the early-September
                    heat. In time, as my body came to accept public transportation (or at least resist it less), my commutes
                    became more of a deadening routine than a terrifying escapade: I rode subways, foregoing the metal bars,
                    reading the advertisements, blasting music through my headphones at unholy volumes. Having acclimated to
                    my new environment, however, my outlook drifted from anxious to melancholy. Was this how I was doomed to
                    spend an hour of every day for four years?
                </p><p>
	                One day, later that year, I chanced upon an advertisement in the subway. It showed a typical subway car,
                    full of passengers like me, except everyone was reading <span style="font-style: italic;">The New
                    Yorker</span>; the only words were "<span style="font-style: italic;">The New Yorker</span>:
                    Where Things Get Interesting." Its message was as simple as it was effective: I purchased a
                    subscription that night, knowing nothing of it save that it was commonly referenced as the plaything
                    of the culturally minded. When its first issue arrived, I began reading and was pleasantly surprised
                    by the clear and lucid prose within. The length, however, put me off: as fantastic as the writing may
                    be, a high schooler would scarcely have time to get seven hours of sleep, let alone read a ten-page article
                    about, for example, the Eritrean soccer team. It was at that moment when I recalled the subway ad: why
                    not read on my commute?
                </p><p>
	                Thus, I began toting around a copy of the New Yorker, and—I say this with no exaggeration, as unbelievable
                    as it may seem—my commute became one of my favorite parts of the day, simply because it was often my only
                    opportunity to get some recreational reading done. The subway slithered through the mysterious seas of New
                    York's underground; and I, swaying on its deck, was transported to the world within the pages while the
                    ocean-liner inexorably sailed toward my destination. Every journey was thus two: a duality between the mental
                    and the physical. 
                </p><p>
	                Even on the most crowded rides, I manage to hold aloft a book or magazine to accompany me. And it is in
                    those moments that I understand the essence of city life: the public sphere. The novelist and social critic
                    Jonathan Franzen describes the public sphere as the balance between assertions of individuality and a respect 
                    for each other's sensitivities and boundaries. We frown upon those whose private matters are dragged into
                    the public—loud conversations on the phone, beggars passed out across an entire row of seats, people
                    not-so-discreetly taking a leak into the corner of a platform—not just due to the immediate annoyance or
                    disgust but also, subconsciously, due to the breach of this public space. Privacy is relatively effortless
                    to buy—whether it be behind locked doors or cryptographic firewalls—whereas the public sphere is the ultimate
                    tragedy of the commons. As I read on the subway, however, I embody the public sphere: I am displaying a symbol
                    of my character, my passion, and my identity; and I am promising to be respectful of others'. Sometimes, when
                    I glimpse fellow commuters reading beside me, I wonder for what cause they are sacrificing eyesight and, by
                    extension, who they might be.
                </p><p>
	                Waiting for the express trains at the 125th Street/Lexington Avenue platforms can be a harrowing affair:
                    hundreds of people clamor near the yellow line, a drummer thumps a beat on his plastic barrel drum set,
                    and the odors of the toxic sludge brewing in the tracks waft throughout the station. Eventually, the
                    subway trundles into the station and everyone somehow squeezes into the cars. I stand within this
                    entanglement of scarves, backpack straps, and limbs, nose buried in a book, oblivious to the rest of 
                    the world. But, on occasion, I remember the words of John Donne: "No man is an island/Entire of himself."
                    And so it is: even as I trace the contours of my novel's plot, I am aware of my surroundings. A
                    skateboarder is bobbing his head to earbuds, an Asian woman is sipping a hot drink from a tumbler,
                    an old lady is reading the Arts section of The New York <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span>. My mind drifts from my book to these
                    people—Who are they? What are they thinking? Whom do they love?—and I heft up my own book, hoping that
                    others may glimpse it and wonder the same of me. For the spirit of the public sphere is seeing and
                    being seen—we are social beings, after all, and few pleasures are as sweet as the realization that we
                    are not alone.

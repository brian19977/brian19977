<p>“… So what do you think Maestro’s goal was?” Nathaniel asked out of nowhere.</p>
<p>“I have no idea,” Miëko shrugged.</p>
<p>   “What does it matter now.”</p>
<p>“The hell it doesn’t,” Miëko glared accusingly. “Isn’t it good to know that he was a gift, not a calamity?”</p>
<p>“You think he was a gift?” Nathaniel looked ambushed.</p>
<p>“I thought so. In the end, anyway. Especially to your kid.”</p>
<p>Nathaniel thought. “Hm. Maybe. Yeah, definitely.”</p>
<p>“Right? How much more fun was this year thanks to him. Wasn’t his unorthodox music what made Masaru’s classicism stand out even more?”</p>
<p>“It’s possible,” he conceded.</p>
<p>“And he seemed to have made a big impression on a lot of other contestants. Not least the girl.”</p>
<p>“Aya?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“She really was amazing,” Nathaniel said pensively.</p>
<p>“Especially her Prokofiev’s Second. It would not have surprised me if she had won.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I never thought I’d be tearing up at Prok Two,” Miëko chuckled. “I’m personally happy for her return, honestly.”</p>
<p>“You think she’ll be a proper concert pianist now?”</p>
<p>“She said she would if she were invited. I’m sure she will be.” Miëko recalled her exhilarated face at the end of her performance.</p>
<p>   “How funny is it that she was playmates with Masaru.”</p>
<p>“Masaru’s completely fallen for her, don’t you think? You should tell him, as his teacher. Pianists shouldn’t date, look at me, et cetera.”</p>
<p>Nathaniel suppressed a laugh. “Didn’t know you were so invested in my student.” He seemed happy even as he sighed.</p>
<p>The two were at the hotel bar; last call was imminent, and the room was nearly empty.</p>
<p>The award ceremony had concluded, and their responsibilities were over. Everyone would be getting a good night’s sleep that night.</p>
<p>But there was a latent tension between these two old friends and ex-spouses.</p>
<p>Miëko stretched lightly. “I’m always miserable and tired all competition, and then I just want to go again as soon as I’m done.”</p>
<p>“It helps when the contestants are good.” Nathaniel sipped his whiskey.</p>
<p>“Yeah. And there are more sprouting every day. We just have to be ready for them.”</p>
<p>“You sound like Maestro.”</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">A gift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">I present to you all Jin Kazama.</span></p>
<p>Miëko smiled. <span style="font-style: italic;">We got him, Maestro.</span></p>
<p>She raised her glass.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Nathaniel asked.</p>
<p>“Raising a glass.”</p>
<p>“To who?”</p>
<p>“Maestro Hoffman.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Can’t let you do that alone.” He raised his.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do with Masaru?” Miëko asked after a silence. “Are you going to send him to more competitions?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Before I could even say congratulations, he was telling me about all the classes he wanted to take. Especially composition.”</p>
<p>“Composition?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s not the first time, but. He said he wanted to create a new classic, or something like that.”</p>
<p>“Such desire.”</p>
<p>“He wants to be a composer-pianist.”</p>
<p>“That should be fun.”</p>
<p>“I’m happy for him, as his teacher. Jin Kazama would probably do the same someday. His <span style="font-style: italic;">Africa</span> was amazing, after all.”</p>
<p>“It was. Jin Kazama at his best.”</p>
<p>Nathaniel looked down at his hands. “I’m itching to play all of a sudden.”</p>
<p>Miëko looked down as well. “Me too. I want to play today, I want to play now. I want to play Jin Kazama’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Africa.</span>”</p>
<p>“I’ve spent too much time conducting.”</p>
<p>“No kidding. Get back to your roots.”</p>
<p>“I should.”</p>
<p>“You really couldn’t predict that kid. Who knows where he’ll be in two years.”</p>
<p>“Who knows who’s going to teach him.”</p>
<p>“Hoffman apparently planted some seeds in Paris.”</p>
<p>“No one wouldn’t take him now. Especially clutching that silver.” Nathaniel laughed bitterly. “He’s not normal.”</p>
<p>“Who said he was? He was like that all the way back at auditions.”</p>
<p>“He’s yours now, you know? You found him.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to tell me, ha. I would be happy to retire from judging now.” Miëko laughed, as though she had totally forgotten her initial fury.</p>
<p>“You boasting—it doesn’t suit you.”</p>
<p>“Bite me.”</p>
<p>The bartender brought over the check. Nathaniel withdrew a card from his wallet and signed. “So have you thought about it?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You know.” He looked up at her. “What I asked about. Before the competition.”</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Trying again.</span> Miëko was at a loss.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you’re still thinking about that. You were serious?”</p>
<p>“Ouch.” Nathaniel smiled, but she saw a yearning in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Gosh.” She frowned slightly. They began to walk. “I have someone right now, you know.”</p>
<p>“I do. But you’re not married.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>
<p>She felt herself waver. She knew that when she liked him, she loved him—that they were fundamentally two strings on the same frequency.</p>
<p>“Tell you what. Finish your divorce and then we can talk.”</p>
<p>“Not a no.”</p>
<p>She smiled bitterly at his sophomoric happiness. “See you when I see you.”</p>
<p>“I have a concert in Paris next month, so.”</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">This man.</span> She tutted silently. <span style="font-style: italic;">He’ll do whatever he damn well pleases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">I miss him.</span></p>
<p>She shivered violently, but he, a step ahead of her, didn’t see it.</p>
<p>“Call me.”</p>
<p>“I’ll save you a seat.” Nathaniel winked.</p>
<p>The elevator arrived; they rode silently.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Back to our lives,</span> Miëko thought. <span style="font-style: italic;">Back to our music.</span></p>

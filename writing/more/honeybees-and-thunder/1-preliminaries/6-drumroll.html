                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The domed ceiling, composed of confident, tall arcs, showered the people packed into
                    the lobby of the hall below with the echoes of their own jovial laughter.</p>
                <p>Camera flashes everywhere. The ones in dark suits with notepads,
                    running hither and thither—those are the regional newspaper and music magazine writers,
                    or perhaps the sponsoring corporations’ PR representatives. As the reputation and
                    public profile of the Yoshigaë International Piano Competition rose over the last few years,
                    national newspapers’ columnists and famous music critics have also increasingly joined this mix.</p>
                <p>Miëko Saga, holding a glass of champagne, stared through the curved glass
                    enveloping the lobby at the darkness of the courtyard beyond. The hall was part of
                    a multifunctional complex, containing a hotel, a shopping mall, and offices;
                    its placement within the complex allowed for a clear view of the entry plaza.
                    The plaza was dark and empty at this late hour—10 P.M.—and, with the contrast
                    between the fanciful lights of the lobby and the eerie darkness lying beyond
                    that mere sheet of glass somehow evoking the pomp of the concert stages to come
                    and the buried emotional torment of those upon it, Miëko felt for a moment as
                    though the Japan’s late-autumn chill would shatter the silicate barrier and pierce her skin.</p>
                <p>She caught a glimpse of her own countenance in the glass and halted: a worried, hostile expression.
                    <span style = "font-style: italic;">Gosh, did I really look like that? I look as though I’m one of those competing
                    conservatory students.</span></p>
                <p>As she chided herself for her expression thus, she ran her palm over her cheek, to little effect.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: center;">

                </p>
                
                <p>Tonight is the opening night of the two week-long Yoshigaë International Piano Competition;
                    the First Round begins tomorrow.</p>
                <p>The opening concert is the recital of the last competition winner;
                    it functions as the kickoff to the winner’s tour in Japan, which tour is one of
                    the awards for victory. That winner failed the document stage only to resurrect
                    through the auditions, and after winning Yoshigaë also won the
                    S— Competition—a star at last; now, the pianist stepped onstage with a mysterious new maturity.
                    Contentedly watching a star one has found as an audience member at their opening recital
                    can be said to be a competition judge’s dream; also the desire to find yet another star
                    naturally wells up in these moments.</p>
                <p>After the recital, a competition staff-only party is held in the lobby;
                    it is here that the judges who had been scattered around the world finally come together.
                    Some contestants are also in attendance, creating something of a global atmosphere.
                    The organizers of the competition, the mayor of Yoshigaë and regional dignitaries,
                    and executives of sponsoring corporations also take part: a bona fide fancy shindig.
                    Despite the recessive mood of the global economy, Yoshigaë, as a leading manufacturing
                    city with half a dozen industrial concerns calling it home, can still show off some glamour.</p>
                <p>“Why do you seem so small, Miëko?”</p>
                <p>The person casually bumping Miëko, who had been trying to massage her hardened face,
                    was Dadaïki Hishinuma. Miëko smiled bitterly.</p>
                <p>“Mr. Numa, must you speak so? Can’t you just say I look deep in thought?”</p>
                <p>“You’ve still got bark, huh? No different to the young girl who couldn’t pay attention
                    to a single minute of my lecture, who told me she hated solfege more than anything else.
                    I turn around and she’s become a woman who scornfully counts her new wrinkles in the glass.”</p>
                <p>“You’re too much,” Miëko laughed emptily, too tired even to fight back.</p>
                <p>The Yoshigaë International Piano Competition always commissions a new piece by a Japanese composer;
                    Hishinuma was that composer this year. From a family of art critic and politician grandparents,
                    a world-famous composer of conservative dress and unremarkable stature—yet a
                    tongue of acid and fire to stun anyone into submission.</p>
                <p>“So I heard the French team dug up something amazing,” Hishinuma said with a spark in his eye.</p>
                <p>“God, even you know,” Miëko sighed and frowned.</p>
                <p>“A son of an apiarist? He’s apparently being called the ‘honeybee prince.’”</p>
                <p>“Honeybee prince,” Miëko said, suddenly unable to speak and feeling a wave of heaviness.</p>
                <p>Jin Kazama. The name weighed on Miëko. Just now, she saw Alain and Sergei for the
                    first time since the Paris auditions, and she was sure that the name was
                    stressing them out as well. Though each had been busy after the audition,
                    they had each researched Jin Kazama and pooled their knowledge.</p>
                <p>Miëko, for one, had thought he would have used Jin 仁, but instead he used
                    Jin 塵; she explained to Alain that the former meant “humaneness,”
                    a Buddhist virtue, while the latter meant “dust,” to which he burst out laughing.
                    His laughter depressed Miëko. It wasn’t enough that they all had fallen into Hoffman’s game;
                    even his name was a tease. His father was sure to be a character as well.
                    Though Alain seemed to treat it all as good fun, Miëko couldn’t help but feel her
                    anxiety over Jin Kazama swell.</p>
                <p>It was kind of remarkable how fast the news—and rumors—about Jin Kazama had swept the field.
                    Miëko tried to avoid prejudice and talk, but it was impossible to shut the world out.
                    The information about him was minimal—he truly was a nobody—but this only served to fan
                    the flames of gossip. If such a contestant appeared only to give a flashy,
                    boring performance—she didn’t want to imagine the fallout, which was sure to be directed at
                    her and the other Paris judges.</p>
                <p>“What even is your expression—like you’ve bitten into a bug or something.”
                    Hishinuma peered at her—maybe he expected her to freak out.</p>
                <p>“Oh, you know. Christ, Maestro Hoffman really was unkind,” Miëko complained,
                    almost involuntarily.”</p>
                <p>“I heard there was a recommendation.”</p>
                <p>Miëko wasn’t sure how he interpreted her expression at that statement,
                    but for once he wore a serious expression.</p>
                <p>“Whatever people say, it is in fact true that Hugh instructed this honeybee prince.
                    I called Daphne a while ago and she said that Hugh did in fact have a student he
                    visited and taught every so often.”</p>
                <p>“What?”</p>
                <p>Daphne was Hugh von Hoffman’s wife; Hishinuma has long had connections with Hoffman’s family,
                    and even after his death was known to exchange calls with them.</p>
                <p>“Maestro visited? No way in hell,” Miëko shot back without thinking.
                    Hoffman was famed to be a scarce teacher, and had never taught outside his own home.</p>
                <p>“Daphne thought it was odd too, and said she asked him about it.
                    He just laughed, she says, teasingly, and wouldn’t tell her who he was or where he lived.
                    What a joker he was. ‘He’s a traveling musician, so.’”</p>
                <p>A traveling musician. Not an incorrect description of the son of an apiarist who
                    follows the blossoming of flowers.</p>
                <p>But how did he teach him? There’s not a trace of professional pedagogy
                    in the image of this boy who did not even know how to handle himself onstage.</p>
                <p>“So what of this prince? I don’t assume he’s coming today,” Hishinuma said, looking about.</p>
                <p>“For better or for worse, he’ll be here on the last day of the First Round.
                    He seems to be flying in just before.”</p>
                <p>A marathon of a competition—two weeks. The First Round, with its ninety musicians,
                    takes five days. The contestants in attendance tonight are either already
                    semi-professionals or playing early on in the First Round.
                    Naturally, some of these people are practicing even now, reflexively more than anything, perhaps.</p>
                <p>From the perspective of Americans or Europeans, Japan is far,
                    expensive to compete in. Even for those with a homestay, the burden is great:
                    it’s only the contestants from the upper classes of Korea and China who stay in the city’s hotels.
                    It’s only natural for them, really, to arrive at the last minute.
                    There’s no real way to know whether Kazama is facing financial hardship,
                    but then there haven’t been rumors of his family’s wealth, either.</p>
                <p>No one’s really to say whether getting judged earlier or later is better, either.</p>
                <p>“The Queen comes hither,” Hishinuma murmured.</p>
                <p>Olga Sluchkaya, tall of height and robust of frame, embraced by a
                    suit of striking blue and exuding a brilliant yet grave energy,
                    the redhead beauty of Russia, approached. Not only was she a consummate pianist of her own right,
                    she had trained numerous protegés and was famed as an excellent teacher as well.
                    Her favorable view of Japan and its culture was hardly less renowned:
                    many of her pupils were Japanese, and her command of the language was formidable.
                    Though she was approaching seventy, her magnetic charm and energy had not faltered one iota;
                    she cast long shadows on the classical music world, and,
                    aided by her talents in negotiation and politics, she played an indispensable role
                    in raising the profile of the Yoshigaë International Piano Competition from
                    an East Asian backwater to a truly cosmopolitan competition.</p>
                <p>“Casting aspersions about me, are we?”</p>
                <p>“God forbid, ma’am,” Hishinuma demurred with a glint in his eye.
                    Though he was barely younger than her, even he genuflected so: Miëko found it a little pathetic.</p>
                <p>“We were just talking about how we’re sure to meet a star this year as well.”</p>
                <p>“Oho, how lovely that would be,” Olga said, eyes flashing.</p>
                <p>She’s surely heard about the Paris auditions, and definitely knows the
                    tastes of the three judges behind them. Olga, oh-so-strict,
                    advocates for a musical pedagogy based on deep understanding and careful study;
                    she’d undoubtedly frown at any antics by the “honeybee prince.” But ever the pragmatist,
                    she’s sure to use any attention thus garnered to the competition’s advantage:
                    otherworldly playing, Hoffman’s recommendation, nicknames—whether they be the honeybee prince
                    or gnat prince.</p>
                <p>“Miëko, lovely to see you. Please come by my room when you have a chance.”</p>
                <p>Miëko pridefully watched Olga’s departure, smiling coldly and tsking her under
                    her breath, and then turned to another group of sparkling personalities.
                    A group much more likely to disdain the so-called honeybee prince.</p>
                <p>“There’s supposed to be another demigod coming, from New York,” Hishinuma said,
                    following Miëko’s sightline.</p>
                <p>“Oh, really?” <span style = "font-style: italic;">This old man’s instincts are too good</span>.</p>
                <p>At the target of her sightline was Nathaniel Silverberg,
                    with a smile so sweet you’d never notice the fierceness of his eyes.</p>
                <p>Curly, light-brown hair with pronounced losses, like a lion’s patchy mane.
                    Normally, genial and relaxed, he’s the model of a charming man,
                    but he has his passions, and, when it comes to music, he takes no prisoners and is extremely strict.
                    Should one have the misfortune to touch a nerve, there is no holding him back.
                    Miëko has witnessed such a scene precisely once.
                    The Nathaniel she knew was vaporized by a man whose hair seemed to stand upright
                    by the sheer energy radiated by his anger, shaking and waving less like a mane
                    and more like tongues of flame.</p>
                <p>He, the same age as Miëko (and approaching fifty, gosh),
                    has no equal as a pianist and recently forayed into conducting and theater,
                    garnering praise and respect beyond the classical world. Though British,
                    as a Juilliard professor, he spends most of his time and has most of his engagements
                    in the United States.</p>
                <p>“A man with hair. I’m jealous,” Hishinuma sighed with a wistful rub of his nearly-arid scalp.</p>
                <p>“Even that’s a lot less than he used to have. He could have played the lion
                    in a <span style = "font-style: italic;">kabuki</span><sup>[<a id="en1src" href="#en1">1</a>]</sup> without a wig, is what people used to say.”</p>
                <p>Hishinuma snickered as though imagining the scene.</p>
                <p>“I heard he was having a rough time with the divorce proceedings,
                    but all things told, he doesn’t look so bad—his skin’s positively glowing.”</p>
                <p>“Are you sure it’s not just because he’s white?”</p>
                <p>Even Miëko had heard of his divorce from a famous British theater actress.
                    He does always seem to get into women problems, Mieko thought to herself.</p>
                <p>Hishinuma looked at Miëko with a curious eye, and then tapped his forehead.
                    “Right, I’d forgotten he was your ex-husband too!”</p>
                <p><span style = "font-style: italic;">Like you’d actually forgotten</span>.</p>
                <p>“It was a long time ago.”</p>
                <p>“Yes, yes. How’s your son?”</p>
                <p>“I got a note from him recently. He’d gotten a job as a civil servant,
                    I think in economic development.”</p>
                <p>Hishinuma looked at Miëko with an expression of disappointment.
                    “Not even knowing what his work is. Come now! Young Master Sin-ya must be a smart one.”</p>
                <p>“Thanks to his father. Even his face seems copy-pasted.”</p>
                <p>After divorcing Nathaniel, she met a man of her parents’ recommendation,
                    a Tokyo University alum who worked for a bank. It was madness looking back,
                    but at the time, with her head still spinning from going round and round with Nathaniel,
                    she wanted a simple, honest fellow, and thought she in fact loved the man.
                    The son from that marriage, as if physiologically rejecting a character as
                    freewheeling and heterodox as Miëko, seemed almost a cookie-cutter replica of his father,
                    not only in appearance but in his simple character and desires.</p>
                <p>Admittedly, Miëko divorced the father before the boy started elementary school,
                    and did not exactly watch him grow up day by day. And with the father remarrying soon after,
                    the image of Sin-ya in Miëko’s mind was still of the toddler bobbing about.
                    As Sin-ya grew, head held high and broad-shouldered,
                    she felt deeply grateful for the woman who had taken him in as her own.</p>
                <p>Though he himself did not play, Sin-ya came to enjoy music,
                    and started to send Miëko his thoughts on her performances by mail.
                    Surprised by the nuance of his observations, she was at once joyed and somehow embarrassed.
                    Nowadays they mostly emailed; she suspected his family knew it too.</p>
                <p>Whom might Nathaniel’s daughter resemble?</p>
                <p>As the thought crossed her mind, she also locked eyes with Nathaniel.</p>
                <p>Involuntarily, she shuddered.</p>
                <p>In his eyes was a look, the slightest look, of embarrassment.</p>
                <p>She knew he had some unresolved feelings for her, and she herself did not
                    have only unkind feelings about him. But his shift of expression to one of
                    darkness did not bode well: she was willing to bet he had just remembered the “honeybee prince.”</p>
                <p>He strode over; Miëko effortfully smiled at him.</p>
                <p>“It’s been a while,” he said calmly, eyes unsmiling.</p>
                <p>“You look good!” she said, forcing brightness into her tone.</p>
                <p>“You as well,” he replied, his expression unchanging. But to Hishinuma,
                    he flashed his trademark smile, teeth and all.</p>
                <p>“Professor, forgive my scarceness. I much enjoyed your piece for the competition.”</p>
                <p>“I’m pleased to hear it.”</p>
                <p>As Nathaniel chatted away with Hishinuma, she watched his face in profile and saw its latent tension.</p>
                <p>He was upset, deeply upset. At me, at my admitting the student with Hoffman’s recommendation.</p>
                <p><span style = "font-style: italic;">Why did you do it? Why didn’t you stop it, Miëko?</span> Thus did his profile, his gaze lament to her. If he had heard that child play.
                    She had the sudden image of his implosion of fury flash before her eyes.</p>
                <p>Because he was one of Hoffman’s few students.</p>
                <p>Because he had flown from London once a week to Hoffman’s home to receive
                    instruction and had still never received a recommendation.</p>
                <p>So it was. Hoffman was, especially to those who admired and praised and
                    glorified him, a wheel that dispensed both fortune and misfortune.</p>
                <p>To see a recommendation from his life’s mentor appear in the fist of some ignoramus,
                    he would not know how to handle it except to bleat and clamor in fear.</p>
                <p><span style = "font-style: italic;">I couldn’t help it</span>, Miëko said in her heart.</p>
                <p><span style = "font-style: italic;">And besides, Maestro Hoffman’s bomb just detonated. There was nothing we could have done.
                    He had already received his “gift” …</span></p>
                <p>At that moment, a stride brisk enough to conjure a breeze passed by and
                    a looming figure appeared beside Nathaniel.</p>
                <p>“Professor Silverberg.”</p>
                <p>Miëko blinked unconsciously. The figure seemed to have a warm, buttery halo about him.</p>
                <p>“Ah, Masaru.” Nathaniel’s expression softened.</p>
                <p>“Masaru?” Miëko repeated dumbly. Nathaniel looked at her and then at the man in realization.</p>
                <p>“Yes, Masaru is also part-Japanese. Peruvian and fourth-generation Japanese on his mother’s side.”</p>
                <p>“Peruvian fourth-generation Japanese.” Miëko studied his face but the only
                    thing to be said was Latinate; there was no Japan anywhere to be seen:
                    the only word that came to mind was “hybrid.”</p>
                <p>The man—boy, she now realized—was tall enough to edge out Nathaniel,
                    and dressed in a refined gray tweed suit without looking at all old-fashioned.
                    High in stature yet soft in statements. Animal yet depthful.
                    He seemed to embody contradiction, polar opposites fused, forced together.
                    Occasionally there are physiques which might best be described as “speed as flesh;”
                    this youth was just that type. A lounging beast with explosive energy;
                    a racecar engine in low gear.</p>
                <p>“Please look kindly upon him,” Nathaniel said as he patted the youth on the shoulder.
                    “He’s Juilliard’s secret soldier. Started competing this year.”</p>
                <p>“Your first was in Osaka, right? Why Osaka?” Hishinuma asked.</p>
                <p>“I wanted a preliminary to Yoshigaë. To get a feel for Japan and its halls.
                    But I didn’t know the rules well enough, and was eliminated on a technicality.”
                    The youth scratched his head as though in embarrassment.</p>
                <p>“Oh!” Miëko cried involuntarily.</p>
                <p><span style = "font-style: italic;">Is this that one, that—</span></p>
                <p>She stared at him. She had heard about a contestant who had
                    garnered perfect scores but gave an encore when she shouldn’t have and
                    so had failed to progress. It seemed this was him.</p>
                <p>“Masaru means ‘victory,’ you know,” Nathaniel said as if changing the subject.
                    “This is Miëko Saga. An old friend.”</p>
                <p>“I’ve heard much about you. It’s a pleasure to finally meet you,” Masaru said,
                    eyes sparkling, as he extended his hand.</p>
                <p>As his hand enveloped hers, Miëko could not help but sigh.</p>
                <p>Victory and Dust. The stage has been set.</p>
                <p>Turning, Miëko looked back out into the plaza.
                    The depth of the darkness and the night seemed endless. The competition was set to begin.</p>

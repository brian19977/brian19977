                </p><p>
                    Allow your correspondent to begin this review by introducing an old friend, N—. He and N— meet while living down the hall freshman year of college; for him, holier-than-thou yet deeply lonely after rupturing with his best friend from high school, the quick-to-laugh, eager-to-chat N— was possibly his first friend of adulthood.
                </p><p>
                    The years went fast. There were bottles of bad wine, swallowed by the mugful during midterm season; a cantankerous, sartorially wacky econ professor who gained both of their devotion; and N—’s two-hour tomato sauce, which your correspondent failed to appreciate for being hangry.
                </p><p>
                    But time and chance happeneth to all: COVID separated them for a year, and then post-grad life took one to D.C. and the other back home, to Warsaw. Two years on, wrangling N— for a trip to Vienna, your correspondent wondered: were they still friends?
                </p><p>
                    Thankfully, yes—more than he could have hoped: a day of enjoying Vienna’s offerings, highbrow and low- (fried brains, anyone?), culminated in the city’s most vaunted institution, the Vienna Philharmonic. As a musical body, it is unsurpassed; as an organization, it stands alone, as the only major orchestra in the world without a director. In lieu of a director, it has guest conductors—the best in the world; also, of course, the occasional soloist, who must bear the knowledge that any one of the orchestra members could certainly have had a solo career, had they only desired.
                </p><p>
                    This evening, it had both: Andris Nelsons, the Latvian-born, ex-Birmingham and current Boston director, and Midori, child phenom turned generational talent. They performed an extravagant concert opening with Prokofiev’s First Violin Concerto, widely considered one of the hardest in the standard repertoire. The second part was Mahler’s Fifth Symphony, a seventy-minute colossus, one with which both the Philharmonic, which once played under the composer’s baton, and Nelsons, an inveterate Mahler conductor (your correspondent attended his performance of the Eighth two weeks prior), were deeply familiar.
                </p><p>
                    The concert was fabulous—of course. But it didn’t have that special something, the spine-tingling luminosity or the molar-rattling grandeur, which should have arisen from such a star-studded evening. In great frankness: your correspondent crossed an ocean for the evening; only for having seen his friend does he not regret it.
                </p><p>
                    Prokofiev’s First is a hard one to get right. It opens quietly; it also ends quietly. Its most memorable section is peak Prokofiev: a short but devilish second movement whose violin solo veers between screeching glissandi and death-hearkening sul ponticello (where one bows very close to the bridge, producing a raspy, quiet timbre). Midori was technically deft and expressive, but failed to project through the hall; sitting in the front row of the first tier’s rear, your correspondent could hardly hear her. The tigress that broke two strings during her Tanglewood debut had been replaced by a purring tabby.
                </p><p>
                    The orchestra supported her well, and the tuba and flute solos were particularly excellent. Any performance, beyond hitting all the notes, must convey a sense of the work’s larger architecture—particularly important in this work, where themes from the first movement reappear in the last. It must also balance the sonority of a soloist and the orchestra; no matter how quiet the soloist, they must still sing and soar above the fray. Neither of these, disappointingly, were achieved.
                </p><p>
                    Mahler’s Fifth … of any artistic set, even one as superlative as Mahler’s symphonies, there must be a worst. This one, in your correspondent’s mind, would be it. Its first two movements needn’t have been separated; its third, the so-called horn concerto, is repetitive; its fifth rather goes on. (It is probably the worst single Mahler movement besides the fifth movement of the Seventh Symphony—coincidence?)
                </p><p>
                    Some general notes, then, on the Vienneses’ music as well as Nelsons’s direction. In your correspondent’s experience, Nelsons runs a tight ship; his tempi run on the faster side, and rubato is minimal. This works to his favor—the forward momentum is preserved, and drag is minimized—and orchestral tutti were both powerful and transparent, especially in the low strings, which are so often muddled.
                </p><p>
                    Uncharacteristic for the Viennese, though, is un-togetherness: the magic of the Viennese sound is in perfect pianissimo strings and miraculously attenuated horns, but both were lacking: the violins quivered jarringly, and the horn blasts of the second movement were underwhelming, despite it being the fourth subscription performance.
                </p><p>
                    The horns—or the principal horn, at least—recovered for the third movement, which was creditable. There’s a joke about horns being God’s instrument—please reach out if you’d like to hear it. The Adagietto was altogether perfect, not slow at all, with bass and harp plucking more prominent than usual. Maestro Nelsons made little *pop* gestures at each pizzicato—perhaps it inspired those strings?
                </p><p>
                    Things came together for the fifth movement, which crescendo-ed smoothly from the Adagietto. The tumbling rondo showed the Viennese at their best—atomically synchronized, with a huge sound from the strings. Your correspondent’s heartfelt applause at the end came more from relief that the evening improved instead of deteriorating than from admiration for the music itself—but still, it was a lovely time.

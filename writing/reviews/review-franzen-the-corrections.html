                    THE CORRECTIONS
                </p><p>
                    By Jonathan Franzen.

                    Jonathan Franzen paints a searing portrait of American family life across geographies and generations
                    in his third novel,  <span style="font-style: italic;">The Corrections</span>. Superficially, the novel
                    concerns the mother of three adult children, Enid Lambert, convincing her wayward offspring to return
                    home to a Midwestern suburb (ironically named St. Jude) for one last family Christmas. But amidst the
                    long-distance arguments and transatlantic passive-aggressiveness, multifaceted and intimate characters,
                    all contending with their own fears and insecurities, slowly begin to take form; Franzen uses the
                    sympathy that these characters evoke to pull his readers deeper into the issues at hand. Time and
                    again, Franzen returns to one central question: what does it mean to be a family in America's
                    consumption- and competition-crazed society?
                </p><p>
	                The first thing one notices when reading—and continues to notice throughout the novel—is Franzen's
                    masterful descriptions. From food—"Wagnerian slabs of Sauerbraten, softballs of Semmelknodel, alps
                    of Schlag"—to facial expressions—"there was a pinch in her brow, a groove of distress around her
                    mouth"—Franzen's imagery can often feel more vivid than reality. His scintillating wit shines
                    through slightly less frequently, but this makes those moments all the more amusing: "She
                    wanted to get an egg timer and see how long this marriage would last;" "He was kneeling and
                    sniffing the plush of his chaise longue minutely, inch by inch, in hopes that some bodily
                    fluids might still be lingering eight weeks after his girlfriend had lain here." Though
                    sometimes he shows off his too-broad vocabulary—"gerontocratic," "altazimuth," or "riparian,"
                    for example—they distract only occasionally from what is overall a very well-written story. 

                </p><p>
                    The novel is divided into five broad chapters and bookended by a short prologue and epilogue;
                    each chapter contains multiple winding flashbacks that shed a little more light on the question
                    of how these characters turned out the way they did. Perhaps because the novel is about a family,
                    and because each character and his or her problems are explored with such depth, there is no clear
                    protagonist. But the novel is not any worse for it—the fact that Franzen mercilessly rains down
                    judgments on all of his characters only make them more captivating. 
                </p><p>
	                At the head of the family stands Alfred, the septuagenarian patriarch crippled by the obsolescence
                    of his values and his body; through his perspective, Franzen reveals the depth and breadth of the
                    social rot that pervades America. In a conversation about the local transportation museum, Alfred
                    criticizes the "romanticization" of steam locomotives and fumes that people "thought the railroad
                    owed them romantic favors, and then bellyached if a train was slow. […] He despised the museum and
                    its goers for everything they didn't know." Goers such as, it is worth noting, his children and
                    grandchildren. Later, the Midland Pacific company, the railroad to which Alfred dedicates his
                    career, is bought up by two venture capitalists. The pair promptly "rip down wires, smash signal
                    boxes, and coil up anything copper. […] Five years after the takeover, the rails were still in
                    place, the right-of-way undisposed of. Only the copper nervous system, in the ruthless pursuit
                    of profit, had been dismantled." All this is followed by a characterization of Alfred's and
                    Enid's bed as the "museum of antique transports." Despite the heavy-handed allusion (this one
                    is not the first: just look to the first ten pages, which are devoted to "alarm bells of
                    anxiety" echoing through Midwestern suburbia), Franzen perfectly captures Alfred's dread
                    of the impending era: people blindly hearkening for the past while ignoring aspects they
                    don't like; profiteers eviscerating well-run, useful railroads to sell its material assets
                    and to eliminate competition; piety and prudence being cast aside as "antiques." No symbol,
                    however, is at once compelling, funny, or tragic as the hallucinations brought on by his
                    Parkinson's. In progressively intense experiences through the novel, Alfred sees a turd
                    that mocks his traditions, values, and deteriorating body: to him, his world is
                    literally filling up with feces.
                    
                </p><p>
	                On the other hand, through Enid, who is steeped in nostalgia, Franzen demonstrates how pernicious
                    a blind devotion to tradition can be. By and large, Enid has had an unremarkable, perhaps even
                    constrictive, life: she grew up cooking and cleaning at her mother's boardinghouse, and then
                    for fifty years she cooks and cleans for her emotionally stunted, workaholic husband. In that
                    time, her only aspiration was to raise well-adjusted children with strong family values; this
                    tunnel vision leads to one ultimate goal in her final years: bring (that is to say, pressure
                    and coerce) her children home for Christmas. Gary, the elder son, arrives only to see his
                    nitpicky mother and ailing father; blaming his mother for the separation from his family
                    during the holiday season, he storms from the house on Christmas morning. Denise, the baby
                    sister, accepts the invitation to please her mother but betrays her displeasure in curt exchanges: 

                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">[Denise:] "I can only come for a few days."</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">[Enid:] "You can't take a week?"</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">"No."</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">"Why not?"</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">"Mother."</p><p>
                    And one cannot forget Chip, who finds the prospect of St. Jude so off-putting that he accepts
                    an offer to work for the Lithuanian government, an offer that was given to him hours after his
                    mother's proposed pilgrimage to the Midwest. No one save Enid, it seems, cares much for tradition.
                </p><p>
                    Which isn't to say that Alfred is some virtuous stalwart of American values or that Enid is the
                    Wicked Witch of the (Mid)West. Alfred was so guarded about his feelings that Gary reminds himself
                    that he's "nothing like his father" to calm himself in moments of paternal distress; Enid, under
                    all of her nagging and Christmastide giddiness, is a simple suburban grandma who wants to see her
                    kids in the home she raised them in.

                </p><p>
                    Franzen spends much of the novel's nearly six hundred pages touching upon contemporary social
                    issues in America: government surveillance, the death penalty, advertisements, Eastern European
                    nations, "medical" supplements for everything from psychological disorders to neurodegenerative
                    diseases. These topics are worked into the plotline in snippets and asides which reward the
                    careful reader with a moment of "aha" joy, and the novel is better off for them. However,
                    the essence of The Corrections is an examination of the paradigmatic shift of culture from
                    the conservative values of Baby Boomers to the newer, urbanized generation, with all of the
                    globetrotting and heterodox sex that it entails. By turns poignant and lighthearted,
                    political and emotional, Franzen weaves a supremely entertaining narrative and compels
                    us to ruminate on the big questions—how should we confront changing social dynamics?
                    different opinions? the unknown? By the end, Franzen leaves us aching for more—more of
                    his wit, more of his sarcasm, more of his deeply human insights. And that is all that
                    can be expected of any excellent novel.

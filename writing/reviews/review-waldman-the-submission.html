                    Novels whose descriptions might begin with "What if …" rarely leave more than a trace in one's memory.
                    In fact, your correspondent finds that the novels which sound typical or boring when described—<span style="font-style: italic;">Pride and
                    Prejudice</span> (English matchmaking),
                    <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="review-franzen-the-corrections.html">The Corrections</a></span>
                    (American family life), <span style="font-style: italic;">Normal People</span> (friendship and
                    adolescence)—are more piercing and more eloquent, for their prose is all that they can rely on, than
                    books such as <span style="font-style: italic;">The Underground Railroad</span> ("What if the Underground Railroad was actually a railroad?")
                    or <span style="font-style: italic;">The Handmaid's Tale</span> ("What if women were governmentally subjugated and held in common?").
                </p><p>
                    Certainly this trend has exceptions, a list of which now includes Amy Waldman's debut novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Submission</span>,
                    which asks what would happen if a 9/11-esque disaster's memorial contest were to be won by a
                    Muslim-American; the book's power lies in its ability to weave the more or less predictable
                    repercussions into a beautifully tragic narrative about Americans', and humans', most primitive
                    instincts, desires, and fears.
                </p><p>
	                The cast of characters seem to encompass and magnify every niche of contemporary political life:
                    the right-wing radio host, vastly popular and proudly Islamophobic; the politicking New York
                    governor; the illegal immigrant family whose breadwinner is killed in the attack; the
                    working-class white man for whom opposing the memorial is his <span style="font-style: italic;">raison d'être</span>; a financier's
                    widow—the only mourner on the memorial contest's selection committee—who most ardently
                    defends the architect; and, of course, the architect himself, bedecked with every badge of
                    the American Dream—living in New York as a professional; highly regarded in his field;
                    multiple degrees from prestigious institutions—but failing to satisfy the American public
                    due to a combination of his name (Mohammad Khan), his design (a "garden" which is spun
                    by the detractors as a model of the Islamic afterlife's heaven), and his obstinacy.
                    Ms. Waldman's characters argue and laugh and cry humanely and compellingly, but they
                    simultaneously serve as representatives of the diverse factions that comprise American
                    culture and politics. If this strategy has a drawback, it is that the characters, being
                    so representative as to be almost caricatures, act and speak predictably; the only thing
                    left to the reader's imagination are the trivialities of plot: whether Khan will acquiesce
                    to the public's demands that he retract his design; whether the working-class white man
                    will come to accept the memorial; whether the widow will continue to support the memorial
                    under withering criticism from the public, <span style="font-style: italic;">The New Yorker</span>, and her friends.
                </p><p>
                    The true joy of reading this novel, though, is Ms. Waldman's impeccable ear for tone and voice.
                    With the spirit of the best writing in New Journalism, but also generously sprinkled with wit and
                    sarcasm, many passages are almost quotable from memory. Take, for example, this passage where the
                    white man opposing the memorial meets the chairman of the selection committee for breakfast: "[h]e
                    felt himself in the camp of the enemy—not Muslims but the people born with silver sticks up their
                    asses, the people who had made Manhattan a woman too good to give Sean her phone number." In one
                    sentence, Ms. Waldman articulates the working-class white resentment against liberal elites as
                    well as foreigners (the negation of "Muslims" makes it clear that, in other situations, they
                    are the enemy); exposes the male ego's fragility, both regarding female rejection and being
                    looked down upon; and does all this while deploying a metaphor worth repeating to one's friends.
                </p><p>
                    Unfortunately, not every one of Ms. Waldman's images is perfect—mixed metaphors gone too far,
                    as in "[b]ile burned up Claire's esophagus, […] and stayed there, corroding her ability to speak
                    or swallow," or feel-good truisms such as "[f]eeling weak meant he was strong, meant he was
                    persisting"—but they are rare wrinkles in a book whose subject matter belies the frequency
                    and punch of its humor. Police responding to heckles of "'Terrorist lover!' […] 'Ma'am,
                    I've got four kids; the only thing I love is my paycheck'" (one supposes he must not love
                    the children); tense conversation between committee and architect—"'we are allowed to
                    impose—request—changes.' 'And I am allowed to refuse—decline—them" (sarcastic hostility
                    perfectly tuned to the key of a C-suite); a kingmaker-philanthropist's fatigue—"[s]uddenly
                    he craved a retirement filled not with chairmanships and prestige and continued relevance,
                    but with him and Edith watching the musicals of the 1930s from the couch" (far too evocative
                    of senescent, soon-obsolete men looking not magisterial but merely ill in their tuxedos at
                    charity dinners): Ms. Waldman's ability not only to capture all the cacophonous and battling
                    voices but to harmonize them, playing each off the other to exaggerate their speakers'
                    frustrations and ideologies, makes this novel at once a journalist's or historian's
                    dream book and a supremely enjoyable reading experience especially for anyone who
                    habitually keeps abreast of the news.
                </p><p>
	                As the novel unfurls, each collision—among the selection committee, the tabloids, the radio host,
                    the wily politicians, and Khan—is amplified and exaggerated until the memorial is merely an excuse
                    for factionalist belligerence to bloviate and for goodwill to be abandoned. Khan breaks up with
                    two girlfriends—one because she didn't mind whether he was a Muslim or not, another because he
                    wouldn't defend that he was a Muslim—and participates in the Ramadan fast for the first time
                    in his life only after being targeted as a Muslim bent on canonizing the terrorists. An
                    impulsive grab at a headscarf during clashing protests leads to dozens of pullings nationwide
                    and doubly numerous "self-defense squads" patrolling Muslim neighborhoods. The widow,
                    initially defensive of Khan, shifts her allegiance to Muslim groups which seek to prevent
                    the memorial to maintain relations with the American public more broadly; she, during her
                    only meeting with Khan, ends up making an enemy out of him. The ending of the novel is
                    merely the inevitable conclusion of such resentment and distrust; cruel twists of fate—not
                    strictly necessary plot-wise but certainly accentuating the tragic tenor of the narrative—leave
                    readers with a bitterness for the characters so intimately drawn over the novel and with a fear
                    for how they themselves might react, should they have been thrust into the characters' predicaments.
                    A brief epilogue traces all the characters after the debacle; some sentimental gestures come off
                    as forced, but most concluding details enrich the drama and the sadness from which the novel
                    derives its excellence.
                </p><p>
	                The greatest novels endure as much for their plots and characters as for the scenes they paint
                    and the era they evoke: one can hardly resist stepping into the aristocratic Russia of <span style="font-style: italic;">Anna
                    Karenina</span> or swaying to the jazz of <span style="font-style: italic;">Invisible Man.</span> No doubt, 9/11 left many scenes etched
                    in the soul of the American people—so many that considering them objectively, let alone
                    afresh, is almost impossible. Yet Ms. Waldman has succeeded in calling upon our most
                    unforgettable—and most televised—tragedy as the backdrop to this deeply felt and tenderly
                    moving narrative. One finds oneself mourning not only the characters but the country, for
                    what the attacks did and what the attacks made the country do to itself. And that most
                    literary act—of enabling people to expand their imaginations, to comprehend foreign
                    experiences, to awaken their senses to the ideals and lives on the line—is also most
                    human, most patriotic, and most democratic.

                    Concert Dispatches: Alisa Weilerstein, 3 April 2024; Yo-Yo Ma and Kathryn Stott, 11 April 2024
                </p><p>
                    Hector Berlioz wrote in his “Treatise on Instrumentation and Orchestration” that the “tone quality of the cello is one of the most expressive in the orchestra.” Indeed, the examples of a simple melody or even a single note of a cello resonating most sweetly or darkly practically equal the number of works written for that instrument. So, when New York was to be blessed, in the span of a week, with two cello recitals—one solo, a rarity, and another with a piano—by two of the most eminent living cellists, your correspondent marked nearly a year in advance what promised to be a week of beauty and delight.
                </p><p>
                    Alisa Weilerstein—the first, giving the solo recital—is at this point a household name. With her two siblings, she was a member of the prodigious (in multiple senses) Weilerstein trio; your correspondent has seen one of the two others, Joshua, conducting beautifully as well. She now has a flourishing solo career and is married to the conductor Rafael Payare.
                </p><p>
                    The second is Yo-Yo Ma, a cellist with a decent shot at being the most recognized classical musician alive today (Itzhak Perlman and Lang Lang would be his competition). Mr. Ma, once a strapping seven-year-old introduced by Leonard Bernstein (!) in advance of his White House performance for President Kennedy (!!!), is now an elder statesman of music nearing seventy, giving his first Carnegie recital in nearly a decade.
                </p><p>
                    And your correspondent would be remiss not to mention Kathryn Stott, Mr. Ma’s decades-long collaborator who is retiring from performance at the end of this season; he remarked in the program notes that the concert would likely be the last they ever gave together. (Keep this fact in mind for later.)
                </p><p>
                    Ms. Weilerstein’s recital would have two Bach cello suites, the first and the third, alongside the Kodály Sonata, a brooding, ecstatic work famed for its two lower strings being tuned down a semitone. Mr. Ma’s, meanwhile, would have the Shostakovich Cello Sonata alongside the Franck Violin Sonata, arranged for cello. Among these larger works, in both concerts, were smaller pieces by Fauré, Boulanger, and others.
                </p><p>
                    Your correspondent expected world-class music-making from both cellists; he found it in one, and not the one he would have thought more likely. Ms. Weilerstein was excellent in almost every way, holding forth on four strings, as vulnerable as a musician can be. Mr. Ma, despite the backup of Ms. Stott and decades of experience on Ms. Weilerstein, gave an effortful, inconsistent performance; your correspondent regrets not having heard him earlier in his career.
                </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </p><p>
                    Ms. Weilerstein’s recital began with Joan Tower’s “For Alisa,” a brief piece presumably composed for her. Neither the program notes nor Ms. Weilerstein gave any description of the work beyond its title, and as soon as it ended, Bach’s Third Cello Suite began. The addition of the piece to the concert, as well as the manner in which it was performed, came off as so perfunctory that it would have been better not to have it.
                </p><p>
                    The Third Cello Suite—as well as the First, immediately following intermission—were given muscular, no-nonsense performances. Ms. Weilerstein drew out low, tonic notes, while executing accents with a sharp jab or brusque swipe. The overall method worked surprisingly well—very Rostropovich-esque—and the Third’s Courante and Gigue, taken at brisk tempi, benefited much from her style. The first movements of both suites, meanwhile, were refreshing rather than staid, despite their popularity, likewise attributable to unorthodox articulation and faster-than-typical speed.
                </p><p>
                    The approach only showed its flaws in the two Sarabandes, the slow, contemplative movement in each Suite. Whenever there was a faster phrase—a section of eighth notes surrounded by quarter or half notes—Ms. Weilerstein played it even faster, as an impatient driver might speed through straightaways on a curvy road. Trills, so expressive when performed well, seemed merely obliging; long lines of crescendi and decrescendi were compressed into half the time, giving the music a limp quality where no larger progression was occurring.
                </p><p>
                    The last work on the program, the Kodály Sonata, is one of your correspondent’s favorite works for any instrument. From the first two chords, the sonata establishes a dark, churning musical language, twisting and thrumming, before ending in a blaze of violent triumph. Ms. Weilerstein showcased her formidable technique throughout the virtuosic sonata: flying left hand pizzicati, singing lines in the Alpine ranges of the fingerboard, and whispered <span style="font-style: italic;">sul ponticello</span> passages were all dispatched without apparent effort.
                </p><p>
                    The entire sonata, half an hour long, seemed exhaled in a single breath; the hall seemed half-dazed when the last chord—B Major, having transfigured from B Minor at the start—rang out. Ms. Weilerstein accepted several standing ovations, carrying her cello to and from backstage, before finally emerging without it: no encores, and little surprise, with her cello still custom-tuned for the Sonata. A wish: perhaps someone might compose a brief piece with the same tuning as the Sonata so that Ms. Weilerstein and others can play an encore?
                </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </p><p>
                    At the start of this review, your correspondent noted that Mr. Ma’s and Ms. Stott’s concert was to be their last collaboration. As such, the evening was a mix of their favorite pieces, warhorses, and statements of artistic vision. This approach, while potentially rewarding and informative beyond the music itself, failed on all fronts—enjoyability, coherence, and aesthetics.
                </p><p>
                    Mr. Ma has long been both genre-bending and widely collaborative: regarding the former, he has brought music to Native American reservations and national parks for accessibility and awareness; regarding the latter, he performs not only with pianists and orchestras but also bluegrass bands and Bob Marley. This performance, as a testament to his long collaboration with Ms. Stott, included extended discussions from both musicians about the transformative power of music and their mentors, lineage, and partnership.
                </p><p>
                    These manifested in concert, however, as hasty, platitude-filled speeches about the “power of music to make us better and bridge gaps between us” as well as “the deep musicianship of Kathryn/Yo-Yo.” Clumsy humor, unexplained and awkwardly laughed at—“I’ve known Kathryn since she was two months old”—certainly did not help.
                </p><p>
                    These would all be forgivable—if you play like Yo-Yo Ma, you don’t need to speak like Kennedy—but Mr. Ma, unfortunately, did not play like Yo-Yo Ma. Granted: Carnegie Hall seats three thousand, and he is only one cellist. But Mr. Ma consistently failed to project through the space, even though other soloists—for example, Ms. Weilerstein—seem to have no trouble. Climactic moments of the Franck Sonata, especially the grandly tragic theme in the third and fourth movements, were lost in the swirl of the piano, which was not particularly loud. And in quiet moments, a miasma of tones often replaced the noble lyricism characteristic of cellos. Earlier in his career—even a mere ten years ago—Mr. Ma filled halls of eight thousand with whispering, heavenly melodies; now, he strained to make even his fortissimos voluminous.
                </p><p>
                    This is not to say the music itself was a failure. The delightful miniatures opening the concert—Gabriel Fauré’s “Berceuse,” Nadia Boulanger’s “Cantique,” and others—were performed wittily and charmingly. The Shostakovich Sonata showed Mr. Ma still on top of challenging passagework, with long glissandi and laser-precise navigation of thorny melodies.
                </p><p>
                    But his ambitions for the recital—personal, political, musical—were too high; nowhere was this more apparent than in the performance of Arvo Pärt’s “Spiegel im Spiegel” (Mirror in Mirror). A minimalist duet of long coils of melody from the cello, so slow as to begin fragmenting, combined with simple tonic arpeggio triplets from the piano, it is somehow one of the most beautiful pieces your correspondent knows. Mr. Ma and Ms. Stott chose to accompany the performances with images “taken by the James Webb telescope, which symbolize what is possible when we work together.” This is not a ludicrous idea per se—“Spiegel im Spiegel” was in fact used on the soundtrack of the movie Gravity—but in reality 1) little actual information was given about the telescope, 2) the photos distracted from the music, rather than augmenting it, and 3) they were not all taken by the telescope. This sort of presentation, combined with the incessant coughing and phone rings characteristic of New York’s dismal concertgoing citizenry, made “Spiegel im Speigel” the most painful part of the evening despite being one of the better musical performances.
                </p><p>
                    Maybe Mr. Ma was having an off day. Maybe he left the notes for his speech in the green room; maybe Ms. Stott did as well. Whatever the case, the concert was, more than anything, sloppy—much worse than being merely bad. Experiments are bound to fail sometimes, and that’s alright—it’s just that, when someone with the experience and resources that Mr. Ma does, the natural suspicion becomes that he just didn’t care enough.

                    Concert Review: Evgeny Kissin, 16 May 2019
                </p><p>
                    Contemporary programmers of classical music face a dilemma: do they fill their concerts with safe
                    works by famous composers—in your correspondent's humble opinion, the far more impenetrable
                    one-percent—or do they explore new and underappreciated music, seeking to infuse old (oftentimes
                    in both senses of the word) audiences with excitement for something novel? When tracking the
                    repertoire of Evgeny Kissin—Russian child-prodigy, living legend, and human shrub—the answer seems
                    clear: one must do both.
                </p><p>
                    The first and most recent time your correspondent attended a performance
                    by Mr. Kissin, he had performed, among other things, a collection of works by Spanish modernist
                    Isaac Albéniz alongside Beethoven's <span style="font-style: italic;">Appassionata</span> Sonata.
                    Since then, he has been careful to explore obscure works alongside their more famous kin—selections 
                    from Rachmaninoff's op. 23 Preludes alongside three from the celebrated op. 32 Preludes, for example,
                    or showcasing lesser-known Jewish composers beside Ernest Bloch—and this most recent evening was no
                    different. The ferociously difficult and rarely performed Third Sonata by Robert Schumann stood beside three of the most
                    famous Chopin nocturnes, while selections from Debussy's <span style="font-style: italic;">Préludes</span>, the pinnacle of impressionism,
                    preceded Scriabin's epic Fourth Sonata. Musicians must earn their reviews with every performance,
                    but Mr. Kissin so easily reaffirmed his status as his generation's greatest pianist that one wonders
                    why he even bothers to tour at all—he could give one recital a year in his home city, and pilgrims
                    from the world over would come to see him.
                </p><p>
                    The three Chopin nocturnes were beautiful, if somewhat perfunctory; however, not even Arthur
                    Rubinstein could make your correspondent feel that the Chopin nocturnes (with the exception of 
                    C Minor) were much more than "pretty," so he casts blame only on his own taste. The first, in F
                    Minor, was taken at a slower tempo than other interpretations, but this lent to the piece a
                    stateliness—<span style="font-style: italic;">alla marcia</span>—that proved interesting
                    and refreshing. Broad tempi and dynamics in the middle section could strike one as excessive,
                    but under Mr. Kissin's fine control, even these sways seemed not only delightful but necessary.
                    The second and third, in G and E Major, were similar in their slower tempi and stoic mood,
                    but the bursts of speed and eruptions of forte made for exciting contrasts. A point of interest
                    was the focus on counterpoint, especially in the ones composed late in Chopin's life; seemingly
                    bland or plodding passagework glowed with a life independent of the main melody. It's difficult
                    to make Chopin sound fresh, but Mr. Kissin provided a new avenue of making Chopin enjoyable.
                </p><p>
                    The Schumann Sonata in F Minor dispersed any notions that this recital would be an ordinary one.
                    Written in Schumann's early period, before he married Clara Wieck, this piece stands not only as
                    one of Schumann's greatest achievements but a pinnacle of the Romantic sonata form: one can count
                    on one hand the sonatas that can stand alongside it. There is some debate over which version to
                    perform: the first edition, which Schumann published and sent to Clara, or the revised edition,
                    which contains Clara's edits on the passages she didn't like, and which Schumann endorsed before
                    his death. The latter has taken prominence, but in recent years, musicians—most notably Maurizio
                    Pollini—have returned to the first edition. Perhaps Mr. Pollini believed that when the recipient
                    of a musical love letter doesn't like what is written, the revisions should be taken with a grain
                    of salt; Mr. Kissin also used the first edition. 
                </p><p>
                    The opening—a descending scalar fifth, on a slight rhythm—echoed throughout the entire hall,
                    before immediately decaying into frenetic, chromatic passagework. Throughout the first movement,
                    Mr. Kissin distinguished himself with incredible staccato and impeccable voicing; during the memorable
                    "galloping" section, the mad, fantastical, over-syncopated energy of the performance was at once
                    Schumann and Mr. Kissin at their finest. Meanwhile, in the softer, more melodic sections, rich,
                    tender passagework was contrasted with a quiet but menacing bass; this provided tension and propulsion
                    to the music even when the rhythm and articulation made the piece sound placid. During the
                    recapitulated gallop section, the first edition calls for broken arpeggios, rather than rhythmic
                    chords. When played well, it perfectly conjures water breaking over a rocky brook, and is one of
                    the biggest losses in the revised edition; needless to say, Mr. Kissin made one feel as though
                    the mist were brushing one's face.
                </p><p>
                    The second movement, which opens with a cascade of octaves, Mr. Kissin's performance was swift
                    and uncompromising—the chords were heavy and stampeding, and always teetering just this side of
                    chaotic. A quick moment to dry the hands on a handkerchief, and then the true love song—a theme
                    and variations built from a sequence of notes which spell CLARA in German—began. It was solemn
                    and mournful, but also distant: in a word, sepulchral. Every variation grows more agitated,
                    wistful, and broken; the music evokes successive abuses in a difficult life, which, when thinking
                    about Clara Schumann's life, is almost disturbingly apt. Of the four variations, the last is
                    especially tragic; though it was slightly less dramatic than would be ideal—Mr. Kissin missed a
                    good opportunity for a true climax of grief, and generally stuck with dynamic conservatism, even
                    when dynamic breadth would be called for—the music almost evoked a sarabande, or Baroque dance,
                    for which Bach often reserved his most contemplative, uplifting keyboard music.
                </p><p>
                    But in the final movement, Mr. Kissin truly outdid himself: once again, his flawless sense of rhythm
                    combined with his laser-guided technique produced an interpretation that was vibrant, angry, desperate,
                    snarky, and even funny. Growling basses made for tension and bite that were very compelling; the
                    chromatic passages were full of color; and Schumann's idiosyncratic and fantastical passages—imagine
                    the musical equivalent of a Jenga tower the turn before it collapses—could not have been more carefully
                    etched. The ending is a burst of arpeggios which swell in a pure F Major; all the anxiety in the music
                    dissipates as reconciliation and joy come together in an ecstatic conclusion that fills one with
                    warmth and relief. Your correspondent, when considering a fictional narrative for the fourth
                    movement, always returned to a couple who chased each other's tails around the same argument;
                    this ending would be the moment when they finally realize their own hardheadedness and agree not
                    to fight again. As your correspondent applauded for Mr. Kissin, neither of their smiles could have
                    been broader.
                </p><p>
                    After the intermission, a selection of Debussy's preludes: though working with entirely different
                    musical languages—one might even argue views of the world—Debussy proved with his two books of
                    preludes that he was Chopin's equal in writing miniature masterpieces for piano. One gets the
                    sense that he is experimenting with his musical style in these pieces—rollicking arpeggios in
                    one, cannon-like chords in another—and so the preludes are, in a word, idiosyncratic. Mr. Kissin's
                    level-headed approach was thus excellent for some pieces and less apt for others, but once again,
                    Mr. Kissin demonstrated his ability to silence a hall filled three-thousand-strong.
                </p><p>
                    In <span style="font-style: italic;">Ce qu'a vu le vent d'Ouest</span> (What the West Wind Saw),
                    Mr. Kissin's technical brilliance and ability to exploit tension (in harmony, in contrasting
                    dynamics and articulation, in roiling bass trills) made for a thrilling performance. Every
                    hair stood on end as his hands scampered up the keyboard one moment and plunged down the next.
                    Your correspondent's favorite performance was of <span style="font-style: italic;">Les Collines
                    D'Anacapri</span> (The Hills of Anacapri), which Debussy claimed was inspired by a trip to
                    the Mediterranean paradise early in his career. One cannot be entirely sure of what Debussy meant
                    to evoke when he named this piece after the Italian terraquascape, because the music more evokes
                    a quiet Italian town than any rolling knoll. Birds jabber, children frolic, vendors hawk,
                    and townspeople gossip; notes are scattered like marbles that roll higgledy-piggledy, without
                    (seeming) care for order or structure. Mr. Kissin excellently captures Debussy's quirkier side;
                    the glittering arpeggiated motif at the end of the piece was sunlight itself distilled into music.
                </p><p>
                    The most intriguing performance was <span style="font-style: italic;">La Cathédrale Engloutie</span>
                    (The Sunken Cathedral). Long, echoing chords evoked Rachmaninoff's frequent use of chanting,
                    bell-like textures, or Chopin's Polonaise-Fantaisie. Is the piano a percussion or string instrument?
                    This piece reveals that not only the mechanism but the timbre suggest that the answer is the former.
                    A little more mystery, a little more ghostliness would have been welcome—it is a lost city, after
                    all—but Mr. Kissin meticulously voices Debussy's chromatic, almost atonal chords (evocative of
                    Olivier Messiaen or Einojuhani Rautavaara).
                </p><p>
                    Not all was smooth sailing, however: during 
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Danseuses de Delphes</span>, Mr. Kissin's mezzopiano sounded rather
                    similar to pianissimo. In attempt to accommodate the vast hall, it seems that he sacrificed the
                    Debussy's intended dynamic breadth. Eerie chords lost their mistiness in a slightly rushed opening;
                    they left a sense of a bell whose echoes were dampened or muted. Nevertheless, these are mild
                    complaints in a tremendous realization of some of Debussy's most important preludes, and Mr.
                    Kissin took a well-deserved, if slightly lengthy, break following the performance.
                </p><p>
                    Soon enough, though, he stepped out for the blazing finale, Alexander Scriabin's Fourth Sonata.
                    The last of his multi-movement sonatas, it marks Scriabin's transition out of his early period,
                    when he abandons the largely tonal idiom which he had hitherto employed. As follows the
                    pattern with his first three sonatas, the Fourth has a tolling, haunting quality in the
                    first movement; in the second and last, the music bursts out in frenetic energy before
                    yielding to joy. Mr. Kissin, seemingly channeling his mood from immediately earlier in
                    the evening, took the first movement at a slightly slower tempo before a prestissimo
                    finale; the breadth of Mr. Kissin's dynamics and tempi made the piece a pure (in the
                    sense that the music seemed to cleanse) and uplifting musical experience; no piece could
                    have better concluded the evening. The hall rose and rose for Mr. Kissin, who obliged
                    with three popular pieces by Chopin and Schumann as encores. 
                </p><p> 
                    Though the evening was muggy and your correspondent was in a summer ensemble, the humidity
                    was hardly felt: with the music in his heart, even the gusts of fumes off Seventh Avenue
                    felt like a life-giving sea breeze.

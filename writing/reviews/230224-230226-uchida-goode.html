                    Concert Reviews: Mitsuko Uchida and Richard Goode, 24 and 26 February 2023
                </p><p>
                    One of the most challenging, most intense, and certainly most common piano recital programs is composed of the last
                    three sonatas by Ludwig van Beethoven, opp. 109, 110, and 111. The bridge between the Classical and Romantic periods—the
                    capstone of the New Testament of the keyboard—the so-called holy cows of piano literature: their status as civilizational
                    artifact almost overwhelms their innate beauty, pathos and ecstasy.
                </p><p>
                    Your correspondent was planning to hear the program three times—<span style="font-style: italic;">three times!</span>—in
                    New York in 2020, the quarter-millenial of Beethoven's birth: performed by Jonathan Biss, at the 92nd St. Y; by Steven
                    Osborne, at Alice Tully Hall; and by Maurizio Pollini, at Carnegie Hall. (Mr. Pollini's recital was part of a series of
                    all-Beethoven recitals by eminent pianists—besides Mr. Pollini: Emanuel Ax, Evgeny Kissin, Sir András Schiff, Yefim
                    Bronfman, Igor Levit, and Mitsuko Uchida, to whom we shall return in a moment.)
                </p><p>
                    But Beethoven's quarter-millenial was in 2020, and so none of those concerts took place.
                </p><p>
                    But in the 2022-23 season, the program was to be performed at Carnegie Hall by Mitsuko Uchida—who, incidentally, would have
                    played the Diabelli Variations, Beethoven's final significant work for the piano, for her contribution to the aforementioned
                    Carnegie Hall series. As if that weren't enough, Richard Goode would play another all-Beethoven program, of bagatelles, the
                    sonata op. 109 (as well), and—funnily enough!—the Diabelli Variations just two days later and two miles uptown (at the 92nd
                    St. Y).
                </p><p>
                    That is more than enough prologue; please forgive your correspondent.
                </p><p>
                    It bears mention that both Dame Uchida and Mr. Goode are advanced in years: the former, in her mid-seventies; the latter,
                    a few months shy of eighty. These are not easy programs; they are among the hardest that a pianist of any age might perform.
                    So it is with the highest respect that your correspondent looks back positively and happily on both attendances. These
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">éminences grises</span> felt the weight of the challenge, but also undertook it with
                    aplomb and finesse.
                </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
                </p><p>
                    Dame Uchida has even performed this program before at Carnegie Hall, in 2009 (not too long ago, given her six-decade career).
                    Though your correspondent did not attend that performance, his anticipation, stoked by her Beethoven sonata recordings, had
                    him fit to burst while waiting for the concert to begin; the night's performances, however, were richer, more delightful
                    versions of her already-excellent interpretations. 
                </p><p>
                    The first sonata—in E Major, op. 109—is the most benevolent of the trio. Its tight construction—the first movement's primary
                    theme is stated in eight seconds, and then moves onto the secondary theme; most of the material for the entire piece originates
                    within the first minute of the piece; there is consensus but not agreement that the piece is even three movements—augments its
                    wandering, contented idiom; listening to the piece feels like visiting the same place over many years, same but different.
                </p><p>
                    Dame Uchida concentrated her efforts on highlighting this meandering quality. Her genteel, flowing opening evoked some pastoral
                    expanse, dotted with sheep and rabbits; the second movement had an appropriately tumultuous quality, evoking cracks of thunder
                    interrupting the quiet reverie. The third movement felt particularly special: the music opens, quietly choral, before becoming
                    at turns amiable, sarcastic, and didactic; by its end, it transfigures into a soaring, shuddering, archangel of a finale. Dame
                    Uchida's chorale was celestial; she gamely negotiated the unceasing transformations to reach the ecstatic finale. Her
                    performance shocked with its vitality and delirium; it yearned for and achieved flight.
                </p><p>
                    Dame Uchida made a curious request, conveyed in a small statement printed in the program: that applause be withheld between the
                    first and second sonatas of the program. This is not an intuitive request; the sonatas don't particularly flow into each other, nor
                    are they close harmonic siblings. Whether because people forgot, or were overwhelmed by her performance, or simply missed the
                    announcement (your correspondent didn't even open his program until after the performance), applause was generally given. Dame
                    Uchida cast a sidelong glance at her audience before proceeding.
                </p><p>
                    Dame Uchida's second sonata was even better than her first. The sonata in A-flat Major, op. 110, is often described as the most
                    humane piece among Beethoven's late piano works: it is the most straightforwardly lyrical, the funniest, the most tragic, and
                    the most uplifting. 
                </p><p>
                    Once again, Dame Uchida accentuated the work's inner character, to great effect. The sweetly lilting opening melody led to
                    crystalline arpeggios shooting four and five octaves up and down the keyboard; the second movement's middle section was jaunty
                    and brisk; the angular, almost dry fugue of the last movement turned dour and heavy as the mood fit. That fugue is interrupted
                    by a chord described by Sir András Schiff as "pure tragedy;" the transition from the fugue into the grieving
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">arioso</span> section, marked "exhausted" and "weeping" in the score, was the best of any
                    interpretation your correspondent has ever heard. The finale, a hymnal chorale, felt all the more uplifting for the depths
                    of mourning reached in the <span style="font-style: italic;">arioso</span>.
                </p><p>
                    The majesty of these two sonatas is to some degree predicated on drawing sufficient contrast between their quietude and
                    climaxes; Dame Uchida's biggest shortcomings were in underpowered fortes and insufficient drama. Her arpeggios—so perfectly
                    sparkling in the second sonata—were limpid and weak in the first; her chords throughout failed to fill the cavernous hall.
                    The finale of the second sonata, marked "again reviving" and "little by little with renewed vigor," felt less like a glorious
                    resurrection than a figure once great slowly rising again.
                </p><p>
                    After the intermission came the sonata in C Minor, op. 111, a behemoth of two contrasting movements: "minor/major, fast/slow,
                    harmonic agitation/harmonic stasis, angular/melodic, propulsive/static, terrestrial/divine," for an incomplete list from one
                    commentator. Its position as Beethoven's final statement in the genre which captivated him more than any other (Beethoven
                    wrote 32 piano sonatas, double the second-most populated genre, his 16 string quartets) may belie, rather than augment,
                    its being not only a bafflingly beautiful work but possibly the most bewildering single piece ever written for the piano.
                </p><p>
                    Dame Uchida's performance was shakiest during this (extremely difficult, impossible to perfect) sonata: she had multiple
                    memory slips; she fumbled her scales into mucky, uneven chunks; the mystical filigree, evoking fog on the Styx, was just
                    foggy rather than nervously uneasy. But her passion was still sufficiently felt; the second movement was almost perfect.
                    A theme and variations based on rhythmic, rather than melodic or harmonic mutation, the movement opens with a glacial
                    lullaby whose notes are subdivided to make the same melody sound first like a ballad, and then a playground chant, and
                    then a proto-blues cacophony, and then a kaleidoscopic repeat of the theme before trills of piercing, shimmering birdsong.
                    The ballad was yearning, hopeful; the cacophony, joyful and electric. The repeat of the theme late in the piece was warmly
                    embracing; its deep sense of <span style="font-style: italic;">nostos</span> made for possibly the most moving minute of a
                    piano recital your correspondent has ever heard in his life.
                </p><p>
                    The audience's gratitude poured forth in overwhelming swells; New Yorkers are always appreciative of their musicians, but
                    this sold-out hall gave the great Dame five standing ovations. She raised her arms—<span style="font-style: italic;">you
                    all are too kind</span>—and bowed deeply at her waist. The final sonata can only lead into nothingness, and Dame Uchida
                    wisely and understandably declined to give an encore. It was the first time your correspondent had seen the lights come
                    up before, rather than after, the applause concluded at Carnegie Hall: no more music was needed.
                </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
                </p><p>
                    Two days later ...
                </p><p>
                    The 92nd St. Y billed the concert as a "completion" of the complete Beethoven sonata cycle Mr. Goode had performed there in
                    the late 1980s; temporal gap aside, the label is not inappropriate, insofar as the Diabelli Variations are not only in
                    musical and expressive communion with the late sonatas, but also contain a neat numeric Easter egg: there are 32 sonatas,
                    and the set has 33 variations.
                </p><p>
                    The last time your correspondent heard the Diabelli Variations—with <a href="191024-lewis.html">Paul Lewis at the same venue</a>—he
                    was sorely disappointed with the performance; not only was the first half of this program a more fitting setup for the monumental
                    variations, the performance itself was far more to your correspondent's liking: Mr. Goode's subtlety and wit shone brilliantly
                    throughout this hour-long masterpiece.
                </p><p>
                    Mr. Goode's selection of bagatelles from the set, op. 119, began abruptly, and felt somewhat prosaic; he seemed more to be
                    warming up both himself and the audience rather than making a worthwhile statement of late-Beethoven miniatures. The audience
                    was still shuffling about, trying to find their seats, and turning off phones and taking off coats well into the third or
                    fourth out of seven bagatelles.
                </p><p>
                    With the audience properly settled in after the perhaps ten-minute introduction (and the hall doors were opened to allow in
                    audience members before the next piece), the sonata, op. 109, began again. Your correspondent first noticed that Mr. Goode's
                    op. 109 felt more angular, more powerful than Dame Uchida's by some distance: the arpeggiated passages in the first movement
                    rang throughout the hall; the chords of the tumultuous second movement, much more overwhelming. Mr. Goode's overall slower
                    tempi suited the piece throughout as well: if an interpretation favors fervor and drive, faster tempi suit better; if the
                    music's details and subtleties are to be displayed; slower tempi would be prudent. Mr. Goode's finale was less transfigurative,
                    less Pentecostal than Dame Uchida's, but he made up for it with a balanced, introspective performance.
                </p><p>
                    The Diabelli Variations—"33 Variations on a Waltz by Anton Diabelli" is its full title—is, in the words of the eminent pianist
                    Hans von Bülow, "a microcosm of Beethoven's art."
                </p><p>
                    (If we are speaking of Beethoven, von Bülow may be his greatest acolyte: he is not only the first pianist known to have played all
                    32 sonatas in a concert series, but he was also known for giving such mammoth recitals as Beethoven's complete late sonatas—no. 28,
                    op. 101, and no. 29, op. 106, the famous Hammerklavier, nearly fifty minutes just on its own, in addition to the opp. 109, 110, and
                    111. Even your correspondent would have balked at attending such a concert.)
                </p><p>
                    The hour-long set contains bombastic marches; cutesy parodies; sphinxlike adagios; extended, grieving recitatives; and a monster of
                    a fugue somehow simultaneously self-deprecating and hyperarticulate.
                </p><p>
                    Mr. Goode's <span style="font-style: italic;">tema</span> (the original waltz by Diabelli) was jovial, innocent without being immature.
                    He smoothly transitioned to the first variation, and the variations were off. Mr. Goode observed every repeat, but did not embellish
                    or augment the music in any noticeable way—studiousness without creativity, in your correspondent's opinion. But his playing was of
                    such excellence that he hardly minded Mr. Goode's musical long-windedness.
                </p><p>
                    Each of the Diabelli Variations has its own personality; Mr. Goode led them in delightful procession. The first variation, a march, was
                    taken slower than usual, adding to its stateliness; the seventh variation, with a minimum of pedal, pealed joyfully its C Major bells.
                    The music was muddled at times—a variation of relatively minor note, such as the eighth, felt trodden over for the sake of completion—while
                    lacking precision and focus in more dexterous variations like the tenth and twenty-seventh. But these were rare blips in a relatively
                    straightforwadly enjoyable first forty minutes: the thirteenth, a minimalist variation of rhetorical chords and long silences, flipped
                    perfectly between brashness and whispers; gossamer-thin pianissimo filigree was woven through the fourteenth; the energetic sixteenth
                    and seventeenth never slowed an inch through pinballing broken octaves and shuddering trills. 
                </p><p>
                    In the last third, however, Mr. Goode showed himself a cut above: being aged just shy of eighty, he proved, is not only not a liability,
                    but an asset of incalculable value when it comes to expressing the passion of late Beethoven most completely. The twenty-ninth variation,
                    a slow lamenting chant, was taken slower than your correspondent has ever heard it, but it only functioned to make the grief more keenly
                    felt. The thirty-first variation, an extended elegy with rich chromatic color, unspooled its long melodic lines smoothly, elegantly, but
                    never dryly. And the thirty-second variation—the fugue which had eventually defeated your correspondent—well, Mr. Goode dispatched with
                    panache and wit, again taking a slower tempo (this is the only variation about which your correspondent is convinced that Mr. Goode
                    changed his interpretation due to technical limitations, though he may just be projecting) which served to clarify articulations and
                    inner voices often neglected in faster recordings. 
                </p><p>
                    The twenty-ninth through thirty-second variations, one should point out, are the only variations not in C Major: the first three of them
                    are in C Minor, while the fourth is in E-flat Major, the relative major of C Minor. Which is to say, the most contemplative, most
                    reverential, most purely expressive music in the entire set is also harmonically adrift, sometimes veering on atonal. So, when the final,
                    thirty-third variation returns to C Major, its sense of homecoming is not unlike that of the finale of the op. 111: almost unbearably
                    beautiful, felt more in the heart (and tear ducts) than the brain. A gentle minuet concludes the journey through the musical cosmos,
                    and Mr. Goode gave it all he had: perfect staccatos, legatos that flowed like oil, twinkling figuration high in the keyboard that somehow
                    evoked the mystical state right before one falls asleep: perfectly at peace, ready for whatever may come next. A brief C Major chord
                    marked the end; the audience cheered and cheered. Mr. Goode, too, received four or five standing ovations; he, too, wisely declined
                    to give an encore.
                </p><p style="text-align: center;">

                    A number of pianists, excellent in their youth or middle age, came to give effortful, mediocre, cringeworthy performances late in life.
                    Maurizio Pollini gave an all-Chopin recital so awful—scales performed fitfully, with zero clarity; climactic octaves barely above
                    mezzo-forte; overpedaling in a sad attempt to muddle through challenging sections—that your correspondent turned away from his future
                    recitals until he saw that Mr. Pollini would perform the last three sonatas. Radu Lupu's last seasons were marred with memory slips, 
                    fumbled passagework, and, in concerto performances, zero coordination between him and the orchestra. Daniel Barenboim still pretends to

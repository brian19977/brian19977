                    Concert Review: Semyon Bychkov with the New York Philharmonic, 24 April 2019
                </p><p>
                    In late April, an entire country seems afflicted by that curious malaise of pre-final exams blues.
                    Students fall asleep in or skip class; teachers return essays a month after submission, stained with
                    coffee, or both; dormitory administrators expect to fit sixteen hundred freshmen into four hundred
                    rooms. The natural relief from such incomprehensibility is jadedness and a half-smirk; but, for your
                    correspondent, the salve of choice for his bludgeoned and drained spirit was a night at the
                    philharmonic, where Mr. Semyon Bychkov conducted a US premiere and Brahms's Fourth Symphony.
                </p><p>
                    The first piece was Thomas Larcher's Symphony No. 2, <span style="font-style: italic;">Kenotaph</span>. The music was Mr. Larcher's reaction
                    to the refugee crisis: a "cry of despair," he said in a pre-concert talk, in response to the tens
                    of thousands who have died and will continue to die while crossing the Mediterranean on their way
                    to Europe. Mr. Larcher said that this symphony was the product of his simultaneous horror and
                    hopelessness at the crisis.
                </p><p>
                    The symphony opened with a crash coupled with tense passages of strings;
                    violins that sounded as though they were being played with sandpaper and trombones which were likely
                    muted with plungers surfaced from the soup of sound here and there. Your correspondent gleaned ghosts
                    of a Sonata-Allegro structure and wisps of recurrent motifs; however, after a prolonged first movement,
                    your correspondent settled his jaw in his hand and woke up to applaud before intermission.
                </p><p>
                    The gem of the night was Brahms's Fourth Symphony. Perhaps your correspondent would have a better idea
                    of how the two symphonies of the evening were related had consciousness not departed him early on in
                    the evening, but the two pieces were worlds apart, in the ideas they sought to convey, the images to
                    conjure, and the mood to evoke, not to mention the eras into which they were born. It seems demeaning
                    to compare Brahms's unrequited love for Clara Schumann to the unrequited hopes of refugees seeking a
                    better life, and yet that is the first connection that your correspondent sees between the two works.
                </p><p>
                    Whatever the etiology of these two works, one of their similarities is an incredible attention to
                    detail on the part of both composers. Mr. Larcher scored his symphony for over 100 different
                    instruments, while Brahms toiled over his symphony for close to two years. (For comparison,
                    Mozart composed his 40th Symphony in six weeks.) Brahms's care is evident in the economy of
                    his music—the first page of the symphony contains almost every motif that will be used in the
                    first movement and allusions to those in later movements—and in his exceptional sense for
                    balancing different instruments and their timbres, dynamics, and projections. Good conductors
                    lead their orchestras to realize the breadth and passion of Brahms's vision; Mr. Bychkov,
                    however, gave an unfocused and occasionally confusing performance that failed to live up to
                    the majesty of Brahms's last symphony.
                </p><p>
                    The first movement, <span style="font-style: italic;">allegro non troppo</span> (not too quickly),
                    was instead taken <span style="font-style: italic;">molto allegro</span> (very quickly). Granted,
                    the musical trends over the last century have slowed our performances (Leonard Bernstein's infamous
                    comments before the Brahms D Minor concerto with Glenn Gould come to mind), but this interpretation
                    rushed through the grand descending thirds that are so important to the first movement, and to the
                    piece at large. The second theme had an overemphasis on the horns when the cellos should have taken
                    center stage, and they were once again over-imposing during the coda. Whether Mr. Bychkov felt that
                    the horns ought to be foregrounded or the horn section lacked clear direction from him, the music
                    felt malproportioned and incoherent.
                </p><p>
                    Nevertheless, there were fine, even excellent moments throughout.
                    The opening, despite its overeager tempo, was gentle and flowing; by hushing the orchestra in certain
                    transitional passages, a sense of tension, even menace, was delicately conjured; the woodwinds were
                    perfectly poised—bright and soaring over the strings, but not at all sharp or shrill—during the
                    transition to the recapitulation.
                </p><p> 
                    The second movement held the mistake which was by far the most inexcusable throughout the evening:
                    either the horns misinterpreted Mr. Bychkov's gesture, or his gesture was ambiguous; in either case,
                    the horns failed to enter all together on the same beat. After that hiccup, matters improved, though
                    in the second movement's climax, the timpani, which should provide the unifying beat for the entire
                    orchestra, instead pounded out its marching call so hard that other instruments were muffled. That
                    this was the first performance of this program is no reason for the Philharmonic to be in disarray,
                    nor for Mr. Bychkov to fail during crucial moments. Once again, it was during the less famous
                    passages that the orchestra sounded its best: the woodwinds uncoiled their melody as if it were a
                    delicate filigree, while the troublesome timpani gave a perfect drumroll in the movement's coda.
                </p><p>
                    The third movement was, surprisingly, the best—surprising because it is less radical than the other
                    three and thus more difficult to produce an exceptional interpretation. That is, it's easier to make
                    a memorable soufflé—well-known, but unconventional—than a memorable grilled cheese. And yet, the
                    pacing was perfect, the various sections of the orchestra were careful of each other's music, and
                    it was all brought together by Mr. Bychkov, who seemed a tad less restrained and a little more able
                    to enjoy the moment than before.
                </p><p>
                    However, by the fourth movement, the magic had dissipated: the
                    music was unsteady and lacked verve and heft. Both the opening and closing chorale was almost
                    sped through, which meant that it lacked the darkness and tragedy which comprises the spirit
                    of the finale. Moreover, the climactic 25th variation, with despairing violins and halting, 
                    fate-knocking-at-the-door brass—for a truly uplifting experience, listen to Mr. Bernstein
                    with the Vienna Philharmonic—felt strangely toothless, and it failed even to stir. Once
                    again, the movement was not without its merits—the fourth variation, with its deceptively
                    simple rhythmic arpeggio, could move one to tears, while the 16th variation held a sense of
                    pain previously unmatched all evening. But these moments of delight, passion, or ecstasy
                    could not compensate for an overall incoherent and unbalanced evening. It was saddening to
                    see the Philharmonic, and Mr. Bychkov, who has produced excellent recordings of works as
                    challenging as Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony, this hapless.

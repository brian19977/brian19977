                    Concert Review: Cho Seong-Jin, 22 January 2019
                </p><p>
                    [Written 2019; lightly revised 2022]
                </p><p>
                    New Year, New Me. Your correspondent, considering what was important in life, resolved to go to more concerts.
                    Thus, for the third time this month, he applauded as the lights dimmed and a musician stepped into view.
                    Tonight, the youthful Cho Seong-Jin, winner of the Seventeenth Chopin Competition, all of twenty-four years
                    old, bowed before Carnegie Hall's sold-out Stern Auditorium<span>&#8212;</span>the second in two seasons.
                    Today, he chose not to perform the Chopin for which he is best-known, but still filled his program with
                    old familiars: Schubert, whose Sonata in C Minor he performed laudably during his last recital; Debussy,
                    a considerable amount of whose work he has already recorded; and Mussorgsky's 
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Pictures at an Exhibition,</span> with which he won the first prize in
                    South Korea's most prestigious youth competition.
                </p><p>
	                Last recital, besides the aforementioned Sonata in C Minor, Cho gave a wandering and ecstatic interpretation
                    of Alban Berg's proto-modern Sonata, op. 1, and an impassioned blitz through Chopin's Twenty-Four Preludes.
                    His program tonight held greater dramatic and interpretive potential, but, excellent thought he was, Mr. Cho
                    failed to meet the high goals which he had set for himself.
                </p><p>
                    His first piece was Schubert's Fantasy in C Major, a single-movement work that is in fact four movements
                    fused into one and performed without break. That these four movements all share the same theme demonstrates
                    Schubert's ability to produce great music from simple foundations; this work compares with Beethoven's Fifth
                    Symphony and Liszt's B Minor Sonata in its economy of musical ideas. Besides giving a compelling sense of
                    the piece's overall structure, a pianist must also contend with the musical difficulties: how does one
                    perform fortissimos intended for a fortepiano on a modern grand? Should they be read as merely forte?
                    Or should they be fortissimo but without the sustaining pedal? Such judgments should be made before
                    performing, and consistently referred to throughout; alas, Mr. Cho leaned this way and that in his performance.
                    Whereas the opening chords echoed strongly, the arpeggios immediately following were muddy and flat; the
                    troublesome fortissimos were at some points given orchestral breadth and grandeur while at others were
                    uncomfortably tight and restrained. Frequently, however, the sensitivity for which he is known shone
                    through: his fast scalar passages were glittering and precise; his chords were minutely balanced and
                    perfectly voiced in the "second" movement. The final movement, a muscular fugue opening deep in the bass,
                    was also the best, being uncompromisingly propulsive and pleasingly taut. Mr. Cho's style is broad but
                    rarely overbearing; the melodic contours encased all the music that had come before it in a deeply
                    satisfying and viscerally triumphant ending.
                </p><p>
	                Four fascinating preludes from Debussy's first set of two came next, unfortunately with a bigger range
                    of care in performance. On one hand was <span style="font-style: italic;">Des Pas sur la Neige</span>
                    (Footsteps in the Snow), a lament of profound hopelessness, irredeemably sad and dark. Mr. Cho even allowed
                    himself a bit of showmanship: the piece opens with a so-called "death motif" played with only the left hand; as
                    he sounded the first few notes, he let his right arm drop dead from the keys for a moment. He also used all
                    three pedals to dramatic effect: the left, <span style="font-style: italic;">una corda</span>, to mute the tones,
                    the right to sustain the nearly-unmoving music, and the middle to let the bass echo as a haze underlying the melody
                    above<span>&#8212;</span>a constant and macabre growl evoking fog at dusk. One the other hand was <span style="font-style: italic;">La 
                    Fille aux Cheveux de Lin</span> (The Girl with Flaxen Hair): it being one of Debussy's most famous works apparently
                    meant that it could be played without the tenderness or sensitivity such a work still requires. The opening
                    pentatonic motif was played at almost double speed, while other chords were lingered on twice or three times as
                    long as appropriate. There was no sense of lamentation over the unrequited love implicit in the title. Overall,
                    it could only be called a miasma of pleasant sounds at best and an unfeeling interpretation at truth. Thankfully,
                    in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ce qu'a Vu le Vent d'Ouest</span> (What the West Wind Saw), Mr. Cho recovered
                    his senses; for this perpetuum mobile, brilliantly difficult, gallop of a piece, he unleashed unprecedented ferocity 
                    and dynamism. In a space of two notes, he went from fortissimo to piano, demonstrative not just of his fine control
                    at the piano but also of his sensitive ear: the fortissimo notes still reverberated eerily as he continued to play.
                    His attacks were sharp and crisp; every note sparkled with color. This piece is a nightmare for any pianist, but Mr.
                    Cho rounded off the first half of the evening with furor and flair.
                </p><p>
	                The entirety of the second half of the program was dedicated to Mussorgsky's <span style="font-style: italic;">Pictures
                    at an Exhibition,</span> which records Mussorgsky's stroll through a gallery dedicated to his then-recently-deceased
                    friend Victor Hartmann. Ten movements, each referring to a work of Hartmann, comprise the suite; a rhythmically
                    disorganized "promenade" theme, evoking walking, pausing, and walking again between each painting, is 
                    interspersed. Despite his previous success performing this piece, <span style="font-style: italic;">Pictures</span>
                    was the evening's biggest disappointment. The fortissimos of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gnomus</span> (The
                    Gnome) and <span style="font-style: italic;">La Grande Porte</span> (The Great Gate) failed to ring
                    with the bell-like clarity from earlier in the evening. The piano tends to resist the more a pianist
                    strains it; perhaps Mr. Cho was trying too hard to make his sound fill the vast space. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Limoges,</span>
                    the tempo was too fast, resulting in a sense that Mr. Cho was trying to keep up with himself, in the same way one propels
                    oneself forward when pushed from behind. And in <span style="font-style: italic;">Catacombae</span> (Catacombs),
                    the gravity and solemnity of the tableau lost its heft when Mr. Cho elaborated on the score with a trill
                    in the bass. Improvising or changing the score should be applauded and encouraged<span>&#8212;</span>the greatest of the 
                    virtuoso-composers routinely did so<span>&#8212;</span>but Mr. Cho seemed to place a display of technique over the piece's
                    expression. Some pieces were successful—the glittering exuberance of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tuileries</span> perfectly captured children at play,
                    while <span style="font-style: italic;">Bydlo</span> (Ox-cart) was a masterful evocation of a stomping ox while wisely resisting the temptation for
                    heaviness. 
                </p><p>
	                Glenn Gould once said that there was no point to making music if one did not do something new with it;
                    Mr. Cho seems to have adopted his worldview, if not his style. Throughout the evening, Mr. Cho seemed
                    intent to do something new with an old masterpiece, and failed to do so. From curious textures in
                    Schubert's Fantasy to strange ornamentation in Mussorgsky's <span style="font-style: italic;">Pictures,</span> 
                    the music seemed to be taken over at times by a "Look Ma, no hands" sort of attitude. It would be
                    well-advised for him to restrain himself from doing so in the future, for he is at his best when he
                    is being himself, not turning himself into someone new. Your correspondent nevertheless looks forward
                    to Mr. Cho's next visit to New York, perhaps with Bach or Beethoven.

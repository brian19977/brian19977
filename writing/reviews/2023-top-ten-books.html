                    Top 10 Books of 2023
                </p><p>
                    If your correspondent were, with finance of indeterminate origin or magnitude, to commission a book award, its mission
                    statement would include some sentiment along the lines of: 
                </p><div class="blockquote">
                    <p>
                        The award shall recognize those works which reveal hidden comedies and tragedies of our time; which, by satire or absurdity,
                        poke fun at stale truisms; and which expand our conception of the humorous, beautiful, and humane.
                    </p>
                </div><p>
                    Such finance as of yet lacking, the best he might do is to write his annual list of books which live up to his imaginary award's
                    ideals. Here are your correspondent's top 10 books of 2023.
                </p><p>
                    10. <span style="font-style: italic;">A Confederacy of Dunces</span> by John Kennedy Toole.
                </p><p>
                    One of those books everyone seems to have heard of yet few have read, <span style="font-style: italic;">Confederacy</span> does two
                    things extremely well: it makes you laugh on every page, and it makes you root with all your heart for a buffoonish, manic,
                    more-than-absurd character (so brilliantly) named Ignatius Reilly. His cartoonish religiosity, his simultaneous agoraphobia and
                    misanthropy, his sheer physicality and lunatic eating somehow sustain a book otherwise without a real plot or even point.
                    Actually, one point: the hypersaturated descriptions of New Orleans life, on whose accuracy your correspondent cannot comment
                    but which make him both dread and hold his breath for his first visit to that storied city. Your correspondent, while uncertain
                    whether he would reread this book, can guarantee it to be a superb entertainment.
                </p><p>
                    9. <span style="font-style: italic;">Exhalation</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Stories of Your Life</span> by Ted Chiang.
                </p><p>
                    Ted Chiang is not a writer interested in science; he is a scientist—or a person with a scientist's mind—interested in writing.
                    His two short story collections explore, with hard, lucid logic, all manner of scientific scenarios: what would a world where
                    young-earth creationism was scientifically proven look like? Where time travel had been possible since the Middle Ages? Where
                    large language models, so advanced as to be sentient, seek physical form? With the exception of a few stories—"Stories of
                    Your Life," the inspiration for the beautiful Denis Villeneuve opus <span style="font-style: italic;">Arrival</span>, for
                    example—this logic subsumes the humanity of the fiction itself, but this comes across more as a neutral characteristic of
                    the writing than a flaw. The rigor of the works is to be admired, and your correspondent highly recommends them.
                </p><p>
                    8. <span style="font-style: italic;">New York 2140</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Ministry for the Future</span> by Kim Stanley Robinson.
                </p><p>
                    If the immediately preceding writer is a scientist at heart with a penchant for writing, Kim Stanley Robinson seems a climate
                    activist at heart with a penchant for writing. The majority of his career having been given over to science fiction of the more
                    generic variety (Mars colonization and so forth), in recent years he seems to have been inspired (by what, God knows) to write
                    about our perishing planet. The two novels cited here are outwardly very different: in the former, a band of misfits in an
                    already-doomed Earth crusade for economic protections for the climate diaspora; in the latter, bureaucrats design regulations
                    and financial instruments to avert the worst of a climate crisis. But both radiate with an inner optimism colored with the
                    pale-blue glow of the technocrat's faith in science and logic. Although our disinformation-filled age has shown this attitude
                    to be comically misguided, the novels are worthwhile explorations of how we might save our world, and barring that, ourselves.
                </p><p>
                    7. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Street</span> by Ann Petry.
                </p><p>
                    The power of this novel lies primarily in how simple, forgettable incidents in just the right combination might result in
                    unutterable tragedy. The everyday indignities suffered by the poor and black—especially in the time of the novel, the mid-20th
                    century—refract and magnify each other, growing and growing until blood is spilt and tears are shed. The writing is prosaic
                    but haunting; the plot, a preponderance of bad luck and yet also somehow inevitable. Life is not what you make of it, it seems
                    to say: life happens to you, and you bear it or not.
                </p><p>
                    6. <span style="font-style: italic;">Babel</span> by R. F. Kuang.
                </p><p>
                    Your correspondent cannot remember reading a novel as quickly as he did this novel: 550 pages in two days, with multi-hour reading
                    sessions, skipped work, and much later bedtimes than is otherwise kosher. The premise describes a world in which silver bars,
                    carved with the same word in different languages, effects magic through the gap in meaning (a bar with the English "treacle"
                    and the French "<span style="font-style: italic;">triacle</span>"—the latter also containing secondary meanings of antidote, missing in the former—effects healing).
                    The silver bars are monopolized to make life profitable for the wealthy and costly for the rest: a terrifying parable of our
                    code-driven world, but also of English as a lingua franca, of Standard Written English—"correct" English—as a status symbol,
                    and of the beauty—and pitfalls—of translation. Though overly moralistic and flat in characterization, Babel is admirable for
                    its world-building, motoric writing, and warnings for our all-too-near future. 
                </p><p>
                    5. <span style="font-style: italic;">All the Light We Cannot See</span> by Anthony Doerr.
                </p><p>
                    Your correspondent is inclined to look askance at any novel touted for revealing (or re-revealing: we as a society need
                    remedial schooling for empathy) our common humanity, and yet that is what <span style="font-style: italic;">All The
                    Light</span> does so perfectly. Set in World War II and alternating between a blind girl fleeing Paris with her charming,
                    protective father and an orphaned boy with an aptitude for gadgetry recruited into the German army, the novel made your
                    correspondent hold his breath, laugh out loud in an Amtrak quiet car, and avert his eyes from the words to seek relief
                    from the hideousness of war. 
                </p><p>
                    4. <span style="font-style: italic;">I, Claudius</span> by Robert Graves.
                </p><p>
                    Your correspondent has found so many—too many—so-called "classics" turgid, self-indulgent, and rather completely undeserving
                    of their reputation. (<span style="font-style: italic;">Lot 49</span>, you're in the hot seat.) This could not be less true of
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">I, Claudius</span>, whose setting's lack of promise—the autobiography of Claudius, grand-nephew 
                    of Augustus and stepfather to Nero (in other words, a "boring" Roman Emperor)—is blown away by its brilliant first sentence and
                    kept at bay with mordant humor, terrible tragedy, and some of the best writing your correspondent has ever read. How often does
                    your correspondent think about the Roman Empire? Since reading this work, every single day: it lurks in every political,
                    military, and sociocultural happenstance, and humanity seems to have learned nothing in the last two thousand years.
                </p><p>
                    3. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Known World</span> by Edward P. Jones.
                </p><p>
                    In contrast to the immediately preceding entry, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Known World</span> has a premise
                    immediately gripping: a tale of an American slave whose freedom is bought by his father and who goes on to own slaves of his
                    own. Such a good premise, in fact, risks ruining a novel, but Edward P. Jones dodges the trap with some of the most incantatory
                    prose your correspondent has ever encountered—on par with, say, Robinson's <span style="font-style: italic;">Gilead</span> and
                    McCarthy's <span style="font-style: italic;">Blood Meridian</span>. Your correspondent struggles to find apt description; he'll
                    settle for the following: if the last movement of Mahler's Ninth were a novel, this work would be it.
                </p><p>
                    2. <span style="font-style: italic;">On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous</span> by Ocean Vuong.
                </p><p>
                    John Updike once wrote that good novels must invent a language of their own (something he himself never did, but). If so,
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Briefly Gorgeous</span> not only invents a language, it invents a wholly new mode of
                    communication; reading the work seems to bestow a new sense, one as powerful as sound and sight. Vuong finds profundity
                    and tragedy in the most quotidian events and items; he stretches language in ways your correspondent could never have
                    imagined. Critics say of certain books that their every word is perfect; in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Briefly
                    Gorgeous</span>, it also happens to be true.
                </p><p>
                    1. <span style="font-style: italic;">Infinite Jest</span> by David Foster Wallace.
                </p><p>
                    The Great American Novel. With your correspondent's third read, he was finally able to read the book like a normal novel—neither
                    desperately figuring out the plot or assiduously underlining every dispensation. Wallace's mournful observation of our
                    collective sadness has never rung truer than in our social media-addicted, politically polarized, "content"- and "brand"-driven
                    times. Infinite Jest is delightfully readable, unbearably sad, and needed more than ever.

                    Bonus <> a book not worth reading: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Idiot</span> by Elif Batuman.
                </p><p>
                    There's something unforgivably navel-gazing about an Ivy League graduate reading about an Ivy League undergraduate,
                    and the shallowness of your correspondent's experience was rendered painfully clear in this novel. Scenes could be
                    categorized into: 1) students doing pointless, unremarkable things; 2) classes either mediocre, superfluous, or performative;
                    and 3) digressions about Foucault, sociological theory, or niche films. Your correspondent lived through this dingy experience;
                    he would not recommend it, nor this book.

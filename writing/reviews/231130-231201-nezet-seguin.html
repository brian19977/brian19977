                    Concert Dispatches: Yannick Nézét-Séguin with the Staatskapelle Berlin, 30 November and 1 December 2023
                </p><p>
                    Symphonic cycles are serious undertakings for hosting institutions and orchestral members alike. The institutions must commit to several concerts, usually over consecutive
                    nights, of a single composer's work—a composer who may not be universally beloved—and even ardent fans attend usually just one or two concerts of a cycle. The orchestral
                    members, meanwhile, must prepare a large repertoire, of which at least a few works are less. (When's the last time anyone heard Beethoven's Second?)
                </p><p>
                    A Brahms cycle, however, dodges most of these challenges: all four of his symphonies are mainstays of the repertoire and neatly fit into two evenings' worth of music. It's
                    an obvious touring choice for an orchestra, and the Staatskapelle Berlin was to give six concerts in four North American cities with its longtime director, Daniel Barenboim.
                    (New York and Toronto were the lucky two to hear all four; Chicago and Philadelphia were shortchanged.)
                </p><p>
                    But then Daniel Barenboim, citing ill health, bowed out, leaving the orchestra in various capable hands—in New York, the hands of Yannick Nézét-Séguin, superstar conductor
                    and savior of rudderless ensembles (he also rescued the Vienna Philharmonic during their visit last year, starting first rehearsals two hours before curtain). This time,
                    Yannick—as much New York's conductor today as Lenny was back in the day—had more than eighty minutes of rehearsal time, and it paid off: over two nights, the Staatskapelle
                    gave the most muscular, passionate, and refreshing performances of every Brahms symphony in your correspondent's memory.
                </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </p><p>
                    Yannick brought his lithe, graceful style to the fore of the first evening. Brahms, poorly performed, can feel academic, turgid and repetitive; these qualities were distilled
                    away, leaving only honey-golden, Romantic perfection: breathtaking harmonies, melodious solos, molar-rattling climaxes. The first symphony is especially conservative and stodgy
                    if performed poorly, but it had all the requisite drama with none of the heaviness.
                </p><p>
                    The opening was perfectly paced, with all the right accents—the timpani beats gave the music a menacing, militaristic air; long, fluid melodies from the winds were as unsettling
                    as nocturnal birdsong. Throughout the rest of the first movement, whether it be the smallest detail—especially forceful pizzicati or an elongated note to accentuate a transition—or
                    large-scale preparation—accelerating through the transition from the development, with sudden, gut-punch pauses, into the recapitulation—Yannick guided the ensemble through this
                    impassioned, fearsome movement.
                </p><p>
                    The music seemed to settle in for the second and third movements—the songlike, flowing second movement contrasted well with the impish, rhythmic third. But Yannick and the ensemble
                    outdid themselves in the fourth movement. A grave, almost macabre opening led into string pizzicati—not piano, as is marked and often performed, but pianississimo and slow almost
                    to stillness. The acceleration coupled with increasingly biting plucks evoked chattering, demonic forces; the shrill winds and horns following it could have been the shrieking of
                    spirits. The music, bitterly struggling—with accented strings and rolling timpani—suddenly opened up, with a sunburst of horns piercing through the churning storm. Yannick was
                    able to slow the music down and give the horns room to breathe; the horns responded with luxurious, rich flourishes.
                </p><p>
                    Through the rest of the movement—including the main theme, a heartfelt homage to Beethoven—the ensemble maintained this richness: the strings' swells saturated the air; chimes and
                    solos from the winds felt deliberate rather than decorative. The coda may have been the best minute of the whole symphony: taking the fast section even faster, Yannick whipped the
                    ensemble into a near-frenzy, strings sawing and trumpets blasting. Sudden pauses reverberated just long enough before the music started up again; by the end, it was almost surprising
                    that the audience hadn't begun applauding. But with the last chord, it did—they applauded and applauded. And so did the ensemble, for themselves and for Yannick: it was a great
                    start to the cycle.
                </p><p>
                    With the second symphony—an altogether more genteel, pastoral, even aristocratic work—both Yannick and the ensemble seemed to breathe easier. Which isn't to say they were any less
                    focused, but simply that they seemed more in tune with each other: the entire cello and bass sections seemed a single unit, and the oboe melodies could have been streaming from
                    Yannick's fingertips. The violins in the first movement's main theme were punchy—swelling and subsiding within a single measure but without a hint of abruptness. The lilting second
                    theme—adapted from Brahms's famous lullaby—showed the cellos at their best: mellow, tan-gold, an immortal elixir made sound.
                </p><p>
                    The second movement, with its alternating sections of slow laments and stormy, churning tutti, was so coherent as to sound like a chamber work. The low strings delicately unspooled
                    the opening melodies, somber but never formless; the brass pealed palely, owls hooting at a funeral procession. The climax of the second movement was superbly rendered: soaring violin
                    melodies punctuated with tutti blasts and syncopated to give an effect almost like sobbing.
                </p><p>
                    The third and fourth movements proceeded much the same: the ensemble, with Yannick's generous leash, showcased their talents to the highest degree; the only obvious error of the evening
                    was a faulty trumpet note at the very start of the fourth movement. But the error was quickly smoothed over with running strings—at first subtle, and then fierce, joyous, and blazing with
                    light. The flutes, oboes, and clarinets exchanging the secondary theme evoked water babbling over a brook, while the brass interrupting them could have been the stamping of hooves. And
                    in the coda, ostinato strings with trumpets and trombones grew from a near-pianissimo to a hall-shaking fortissimo, with not one note wasted or beat misjudged. Your correspondent only
                    wishes that the audience could have let the music evaporate for another second before applauding, but he does not blame them.
                </p><p>
                    Yannick received his applause graciously, and indicated each of his sections in turn. After perhaps the fourth ovation, he held up his hands and offered his thanks for New York's hospitality
                    to the ensemble, and his sympathy to Mr. Barenboim. The evening concluded with a dry joke: "We do not have an encore for you tonight, but we have two that you can enjoy—tomorrow!"
                </p><p style="text-align: center;">
                    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </p><p>
                    That tomorrow arrived, and boy, did it announce itself. Your correspondent is tempted to say it was more of the same excellent music-making, and for the third symphony, it was: from the heraldic
                    opening three notes, the symphony seemed exhaled in a single breath. But the fourth symphony—arguably Brahms's most perfect creation, and certainly his most sublime, devastating, and
                    titanic—has a decent claim the best symphony of your correspondent's concertgoing career.
                </p><p>
                    The opening of the symphony is deceptive in its simplicity: a simple melody in the violins, arpeggiated accompaniment in the low strings, and gentle blasts—toots, really—from the winds. But those
                    toots are in fact harmonized but otherwise identical to the main melody. And this sort of trick—a theme developed simultaneously with its presentation, or altered for a completely different character
                    or mood—occurs almost nonstop in the work. Presenting this symphony as a coherent whole, rather than a jumble of ideas, then, becomes a paramount task, and a challenging one.
                </p><p>
                    In Yannick's hands, the whole of the first movement flowed as if entirely, continuously generated from the opening theme, a melancholic chant that is secretly just a chain of falling thirds. The
                    fanfare statements were bold without being brash—the flutes could be heard despite the trumpets—and the divine second theme pulsed out from the horns and cellos, certainly the two most eloquent
                    instruments in the orchestra. The mysterious development, replete with whispering, archlike figurations, gave way to the recapitulation and eventually the coda: a true monster of a section, with
                    the fanfares now devilish, the theme now colossal and syncopated, the timpani echoing like some Plutonic monster. The tremendous finale passage, with its cataclysmic plagal cadence, had your
                    correspondent grasping his seat's arms.
                </p><p>
                    Yannick led the ensemble into the second movement as soon as the last chord had evaporated; the French horn became an Alpenhorn, singing its soulful song somehow both intimately and as if from a
                    great distance. Pizzicato strings could have been the absentminded plucking of a shepherd boy, and the leaping flute figures his cheerful whistling. But the simple melody—two repeated notes with
                    an innocuous dotted gesture—swelled and swelled until it became a thunderstorm of mountainous proportions. And just as quickly as the storm came, it dissipated, leaving behind a landscape both
                    peaceful and irrevocably changed.
                </p><p>
                    The third movement, a jocose scherzo—and the only movement of the four symphonies to feature a triangle—provided a light, much-needed reprieve before the fourth, a passacaglia of thirty variations,
                    three climaxes, and infinite melodies. "Silky" is not a word that describes most Brahms—but here, the music achieved a remarkable smoothness in service of Brahms's greatest orchestral movement.
                    The opening chorale sublimated directly into the nervous first variation, and the oboes and clarinets seemed to surface from the first variation's last quiet horn blast directly into the second.
                    Such magical transitions abounded in the movement, but the music had more than transitions going for it: the twelfth variation, a plaintive flute solo, was good enough to hold one's breath for;
                    agogic pauses before the recapitulation seemed to stop time, a drop of mercury hanging on by a thread. And, at the end, the ensemble let it all out for one final coda: white-hot strings ringing
                    doom into the air, trumpets and trombones summoning the dead, timpani measuring out the final moments of existence itself. Yannick had one last trick up his sleeve—starting the last bar piano,
                    and then driving it up to fortissimo—and then it was all over.
                </p><p>
                    Once again, the audience had many standing ovations for the musicians; once again, Yannick had nothing but praise for his ensemble. They, for one, seemed rightly delighted, in themselves and in
                    Yannick: during one ovation, when he indicated them to rise, they waved their bows, clapped, and remained seated: <span style="font-style: italic;">this one is yours</span>. It was a delight,
                    in turn, to see what felt like all of New York come together in joyous celebration. Such is Brahms, and such is Yannick. May both of their torches burn bright and long.

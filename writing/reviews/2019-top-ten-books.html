                    Top 10 Books of 2019
                </p><p>
                    10. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Underground Railroad</span> by Colson Whitehead.
                </p><p>
                    This book received delighting reviews from every newspaper with a literature section when it
                    was published, and they were not wrong: Whitehead maneuvers what could be a superficial and
                    theatrical twist on the historical escape route of slaves dexterously and grippingly. His
                    characters step from the page, whether they describe the loss of a one-yard-square plot of
                    land to their fellow slaves or their horror as they watch less-fortunate escapees lynched
                    in the public square before aloof, almost-bored townspeople. Besides its gimmick (and a
                    well-executed one, as stated), however, it has little to distinguish it from other slave
                    narratives, well-written as many of them are.
                </p><p>
                    9. <span style="font-style: italic;">Immortaility</span> by Milan Kundera.
                </p><p>
                    Kundera's novels always leave your correspondent slightly dizzy: in their plot, in their
                    philosophy, in their questions, they tend to orbit some indeterminate point until they
                    hit you backside the head and leave you, flattened, questioning all that you've known.
                    Featuring a fascinating ensemble of characters, from a tire-slashing professor to Johann
                    Wolfgang von Goethe to the author himself, the book compels us to face deep-seated
                    prejudices, hopes, and beliefs and ask questions so bafflingly deep they seem parodical:
                    "Who am I?" "What does it mean to live?" "What is legacy?" For mordant wit, piercing
                    intelligence, and a langorous plot, look no further.
                </p><p>
                    8. <span style="font-style: italic;">Tender is the Night</span> by F. Scott Fitzgerald.
                </p><p>
                    Five years after <span style="font-style: italic;">The Great Gatsby</span>, readers
                    awaited the release of the hard-writing, harder-partying Fitzgerald's new book, to
                    respond with dismay. Sure, the mental illness of Nicole and alcoholism of Dick reflect
                    the turbulence underlying their glamorous lifestyle, but the greatest writers, when
                    seemingly at the zenith of their creative powers, are, rather, often channeling their
                    powers of observation and articulation. The winding, brooding, inky blackness of a
                    novel is not meant to cheer one up, but then neither is <span style="font-style: italic;">
                    The Odyssey.</span> Rarely has the final line of a novel landed so punishingly.
                </p><p>
                    7. <span style="font-style: italic;">In Cold Blood</span> by Truman Capote.
                </p><p>
                    Have you ever read a story in <span style="font-style: italic;">The New Yorker</span>
                    and wished that it went on for a bit longer? Say, 330 pages longer? Capote's true
                    crime nonfiction novel, sensational when first released, retains its capacity to
                    chill today. It expends enormous text explicating the backgrounds, characters, and
                    thought processes of the two murderers, and while this does not necessarily make for
                    the most interesting reading, the scenes of their back-to-back hanging, as well as
                    their process by which they were convicted and sentenced—just by all appearance,
                    and yet entirely backward considering modern psychology—finally compelled your
                    correspondent to come out as against the death penalty.
                </p><p>
                    6. <span style="font-style: italic;">On Chesil Beach</span> by Ian McEwan and
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">The Sense of an Ending</span> by Julian Barnes.
                </p><p>
                    These two slender ( < 200 pages) novels by British authors follow superficially
                    different but essentially similar scenarios for the modern conscience to contemplate:
                    how do we coexist with people of different temperaments, upbringings, and worldviews?
                    McEwan's novel follows, with flashbacks, the wedding night of a couple whose sexual
                    opinions are diametrically opposed; Barnes conjures an elderly man tracking down the
                    diary of a deceased friend, bumping into ghosts of his past along the way. Both seem
                    to say that we are hopeless in changing the ways of others, but that there is hope
                    for reconciliation—or, at least, understanding. These are both perfect novels to be
                    read in a single day—somewhere autumn leaves are blowing or spring rains are pattering.
                </p><p>
                    5. <span style="font-style: italic;">Rules of Civility</span> by Amor Towles.
                </p><p>
                    The first novel of an investment-banker-turned-writer, the rise of two girls seeking
                    fame and fortune in 1930s New York is bound to charm your correspondent. But this one
                    has an especial place in the pantheon of New York novels—no mean feat, considering that
                    it is packed to capacity already by such eminences as Edith Wharton, Tom Wolfe, and Garth
                    Risk Hallberg and his modern beast <span style="font-style: italic;">City on Fire</span>
                    (which would have made last year's list had your correspondent thought to compose one)—because
                    it takes loneliness, indignity, and mundanity—the bread and butter of a New York
                    lifestyle—and transfigures them into the vitality and exuberance we so love in our city.
                    Though more modest in ambition than its successor, it resonates with the spirit of the city
                    at a deeper frequency.
                </p><p>
                    4. <span style="font-style: italic;">Purity</span> by Jonathan Franzen.
                </p><p>
                    Given that Franzen is your correspondent's favorite author, it may be unfair to other authors
                    to place him on this list—"Come on, we know you like him, give others a chance for once"—but
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">de gustibus non disputandum est</span>, and so here is another
                    Franzen appraisal. Authors must earn their stars with every new book, and, while many felt that
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Purity</span> was a significant disappointment after 
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Freedom</span>, your author felt that it was a boundary-breaking
                    moment of growth for the sexagenarian author. Up until now, Franzen concerned himself with
                    relationships—three of his previous four novels had centered on a single family's dynamic,
                    while the other examined a single couple's. But in <span style="font-style: italic;">Purity</span>, Franzen examined lovers, friends,
                    enemies, a mother and daughter, and hookup partners—in short, more heterodox than ever fleshed
                    out before. It, more than any other of his oeuvre, is most perennially present, rather than an
                    encasement of the times during which it was wrought—important as that undeniably is. Slow first
                    50 pages? Get over it—it's worth it.
                </p><p>
                    3. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Idiot</span> by Fyodor Dostoevsky.
                </p><p>
                    Your correspondent first read this novel in the summer entering tenth grade—no wonder, then,
                    that he remembered little of the plot or themes at the start of his second reading, many years
                    later. The years had only deepened his sense of the tragic, though, and so Prince Myshkin's
                    hapless goings-on with St. Petersburg's ruthless, heartless nobility struck him as unbearably sad,
                    as opposed to merely unpleasant. Dostoevsky's masterpieces—in your correspondent's opinion, more so
                    than <span style="font-style: italic;">Crime and Punishment</span>, almost certainly his
                    better-known work—are hard to distil into one hundred fifty words, let alone a book of their
                    own right, but this will have to do. 
                </p><p>
                    2. <span style="font-style: italic;">Hamlet</span> by William Shakespeare.
                </p><p>
                    Ditto the above: the ease of a work's distil-ability is in inverse proportion to its mastery.
                    This being your correspondent's first reading, he was more focused on matters of plot than of
                    theme or language, but all came together in a literally breathtaking sweep. It's perhaps the
                    first work of Shakespeare that made your correspondent viscerally feel how amazing of a writer
                    Shakespeare was.
                </p><p>
                    1. <span style="font-style: italic;">A Little Life</span> by Hanya Yanagihara.
                </p><p>
                    The book, even before one opens to its first page, is unlike most others: the cover depicts a man
                    in intense pain or sorrow, and it lands with a thud (it totals over 800 pages). But the physical
                    weight of the book becomes a feather in comparison to its emotional barrage, which might be compared
                    to a bullet train to the gut. Speaking of guts: if Chuck Palahnuik's "Guts" could reduce a room to
                    mass exodus and bouts of fainting, <span style="font-style: italic;">A Little Life</span> can reduce
                    even the most temperamentally reticent individuals (read: yours truly) to weeping. Yanagihara's
                    excellence lies in making her readers empathize and invest with her characters, and then ruining our
                    souls by ruining their lives. So great is the pathos it depicts that your correspondent started reading
                    about the Yemeni civil war as a reprieve from the novel. Wrong though it may be to read about real
                    suffering as a salve to imagined suffering, one cannot help but fall for Yanagihara's trap: she's just
                    that good. Though the book could have used a slightly more judicious editor, for length as well as
                    plot, its indulgences can be forgiven: any missteps pale in comparison to the fact that this novel
                    is the only work of art—music, painting, statuary, literature—that has ever made your correspondent cry.

                    Bonus <> a book not worth reading: <span style="font-style: italic;">American Pastoral</span> by Philip Roth.
                </p><p>
                    There are exquisite moments, and there are interminable quarters of an hour. Philip Roth is an American
                    icon, and yet no verb better captures your correspondent's reading experience than "trudging." Pulitzer
                    be damned, this one's going to the "sell back to the Strand" box.

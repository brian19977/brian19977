                    I started writing reviews late in high school for the basest reason imaginable: to feel as though I had
                    taste and opinions and authority worth promulgating. By that point I was already familiar with the important 
                    reviewers of my time—Kakutani, Tommasini, Wells—and my mother was an assiduous Yelp writer as well. 
                    My <a href="review-franzen-the-corrections.html">first review</a> was of one of my favorite novels, <span style="font-style: italic">
                    The Corrections</span> by Jonathan Franzen, for a school assignment; though it is a little overeager,
                    and certainly more essaystic than journalistic (it was for school, after all), it still stands as one of my favorites among my own. 
                </p><p>
                    But beyond the so-called "critical appraisal," the experience of actually writing a review taught me how, quite literally,
                    to re-view: to consider, one more time and more carefully, the books, concerts, theater, and more which I so enjoy—and to
                    question why I enjoy (or don't enjoy) them. People often say journaling helps them to think carefully about their day;
                    reviewing the arts serves the same function, albeit in a more structured manner than most journals.
                </p><p>
                    I've decided to share these reviews, not (only) to possibly suggest the next concert you might attend or book you might read,
                    but to show you more of myself: of what moves me to laughter, to groans, to tears. I hope my reviews evoke for you the experiences
                    with the arts that I have been so lucky to have.
                </p>

                    On Sir Simon Rattle with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, 2 May 2024:
                </p><p>
                    America—that is: D.C., Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York—has been lucky, for the last few weeks, to be graced by Sir Simon Rattle and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, or, in German, <span style="font-style: italic;">Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks</span>, which is much more fun to say.
                </p><p>
                    Sir Simon Rattle is a man who declined to continue at the Berlin Philharmonic, that peak of classical music, for the London Symphony Orchestra, and then, even more inexplicably, for the Bavarians. He has left only superb recordings and goodwill in his wake—also an achievement.
                </p><p>
                    There is a remarkable history of radio and broadcast orchestras throughout Europe: Paris's and Frankfurt's, as well as the BBC's, are excellent. The NHK (Japan) and KBS (Korea) Symphony Orchestras bear mention as well. The BRSO is in august company.
                </p><p>
                    Tonight's first half consisted of a three-minute Hindemith work, "Ragtime (Well-Tempered)," and a song cycle by Alexander von Zemlinsky. The main piece of the evening, Mahler Six, functions perfectly well as the entirety of a concert. Why add the other two, hardly twenty minutes of music together, and then also necessitate a break? In any event, your correspondent declined to attend the first "half," arriving right at the start of intermission.
                </p><p>
                    Mahler Six is rarely performed. The reasons make sense, and yet they don't. It's long, yes—with a fourth movement reaching half an hour. (The iconic hammer punctuates that admittedly long movement with strikes from the heavens.) It requires huge orchestral forces—a tough sell in today's belt-tightening times. (The nickname—"Tragic"—should give the marketing department something to work with.) It's just not very well known. (So what?)
                </p><p>
                    Sir Rattle came onstage, betraying his seven decades only in the pearlescence of his hair. The first movement opened briskly: the typical interpretation. With Mahler, typical is fine: good music can—often should—be played straight, without embellishment or pique. 
                </p><p>
                    The Bavarians' interpretation was typical, yes. What was atypical was their superlative technique. In a word: texture. Theirs was exceedingly clear; your correspondent noticed details in the basses which he'd never heard in any recording. Not just a motif or detail, either. A golden thread of melody in the Andante uncoiled and expanded, leaving bliss in its wake. When the hall goes still, you know: something magical is happening.
                </p><p>
                    The woodwinds could be heard well, even in the densest moments or powerful climaxes. The principal oboe seemed amplified, he projected so well. And the flutes' crystalline melodies held their own against the trumpets in their solos. The woodwinds raised their instruments to point straight out during certain moments—perhaps that's why? If so, more orchestras should do it; it's also delightful to watch.
                </p><p>
                    Now, about the hammer. It had a good timbre—"brief and mighty, but dull in resonance," is how Mahler described it. It's hard for something to be mighty and dull at the same time. The Bavarians found (made?) a good hammer: it filled the hall. Its player(?) also gave the hammer everything he had: good for him.
                </p><p>
                    However, Sir Rattle skipped the third hammer blow. With such a good hammer, it seems a pity to only use it twice. He also ordered the Andante second and the scherzo third. He is in the majority with the former decision, the minority with the latter. Your correspondent disagrees with both—but, for the first time, was convinced of the validity of the Andante-Scherzo order. Changing your correspondent's mind—now there's an achievement. Another achievement? Getting New York's applause-happy audience to wait until the baton is dropped. Sir Rattle: hats off. <span style="font-style: italic;">Bayerischen Rundfunks: sehr gut—danke</span>!

                    On Yuja Wang, 10 May 2024:
                </p><p>
                    "Is Messiaen jazzy?"
                </p><p>
                    Thus Yuja Wang asked on Instagram before her recital at Carnegie Hall. The program opened with two works from the French modernist Olivier Messiaen's <span style="font-style: italic;">Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant-Jesus</span> (Twenty Meditations on the Child-Jesus), his magnum opus and the pianistic Everest of our time. The music is kaleidoscopic, delirious, ecstatic.
                </p><p>
                    But jazzy?
                </p><p>
                    Classical music has always had an uneasy relationship with jazz, its more rambunctious, more popular cousin. Amor Towles wrote about it memorably:
                </p><p class="blockquote">
                    When the Count had first encountered jazz, he hadn't much of an affinity for it. He had been raised to appreciate music of sentiment and nuance, music that rewarded patience and attention with crescendos and diminuendos, allegros and adagios artfully arranged over four whole movements.
                    <br><br>
                    And yet, the art form had grown on him. Jazz seemed a naturally gregarious force—one that was a little unruly and prone to say the first thing that popped into its head, but generally of good humor and friendly intent.
                </p><p>
                    But transplanting jazz—the freedom, the energy—onto classical music is not always a successful endeavor, and so your correspondent wondered how the greatest technician alive would answer the question.
                </p><p>
                    Ms. Wang's Messiaen was free, yes—and energetic, yes. "Le baiser de l'Enfant-Jésus" ("The kiss of the Child-Jesus"), the first piece, opens with a sepulchral majesty; it is, for all its dissonances, deeply moving. Ms. Wang's technique was on full display here, but in the negative: she demonstrated her skill through her restraint. The chords rippled out, pianissimo and yet with heft: a rare ability. And "Regard de l'Ésprit de joie" ("Meditation on the spirit of joy") had a sense of the Pentecostal about it. The climactic chords—called "the theme of joy" by Messiaen—came across as something beyond joy: rapture or ecstasy, perhaps. This, too, Ms. Wang conveyed marvelously with her sharp staccato attacks, her shimmering arpeggios, her fistfuls of cluster chords.
                </p><p>
                    Does all this suggest jazziness? Your correspondent couldn't say, but she convincingly expressed their shared essence—<span style="font-style: italic;">joie de vivre</span>, love of fellowship and fellow man, embrace of both suffering and happiness.
                </p><p>
                    The first half of the evening continued the theme of joy, in its various forms. Next was Debussy's <span style="font-style: italic;">L'Isle Joyeuse</span>—the piece, more than any until that point, best capturing the sensation of ecstasy. Ms. Wang's trills—vectors of energy arcing from the piano—were more than up to the task; she dispatched the fiendish work as easily as if she were warming up. The next work, Scriabin's Eighth Sonata, was less successful: her textures were muddled, not mystical; pianissimo passages dissolved into a miasma of overtones. It is rarely performed—only twice previously in Carnegie Hall's history—and Ms. Wang failed to make a case for renewed relevance.
                </p><p>
                    The second half consisted of the Chopin ballades. Ms. Wang is not much associated with Chopin—rather Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Ravel—and perhaps the tragic ballades were meant to contrast the joyous first half. The opening—the second ballade—would support that intuition: the most tragic of the four was also the best-executed, with hushed, pulsing chords in the opening and a cataclysmic coda. The others were much more prosaic—it was hard to believe it was Yuja Wang and not a talented but still-growing youth.
                </p><p>
                    As usual, Ms. Wang was generous with her encores. Her Shostakovich prelude-and-fugue and a catchy jazz number were excellent and much-appreciated; her nutty symphonic improvisation on the Blue Danube waltz was bloated and overeager. But the last—the Feinberg transcription of the Tchaikovsky <span style="font-style: italic;">Pathétique</span> scherzo—was Ms. Wang at her best: way over the top and completely nailing it.
                </p><p id="concert3">
                    On <span style="font-style: italic;">The Hours</span>, 15 May 2024:
                </p><p>
                    The Metropolitan Opera has taken some big swings at contemporary repertoire lately: <span style="font-style: italic;">Fire Shut Up In My Bones</span> (Terence Blanchard), <span style="font-style: italic;">Dead Man Walking</span> (Jake Heggie), <span style="font-style: italic;">Akhnaten</span> (Philip Glass). These, from the last five years, have been tremendously popular and critically acclaimed, leading to orchestra seats selling for hundreds of dollars and sold-out seasons despite them. Opera is alive and well in New York—at least in the way that matters to its underwriters.
                </p><p>
                    Kevin Puts's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Hours</span> is one of them, the Met's golden geese. Debuted last season and based on the novel and movie (also scored by Philip Glass), the opera is a triptych unified by the motif of Virginia Woolf's <span style="font-style: italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>. The three settings—Virginia Woolf herself, in early 20th-century England; an unhappy housewife in mid-century Los Angeles; and an editor celebrating and mourning a friend-cum-lover in late-century New York—resonate in their oppressiveness and their characters' dreams of escape therefrom.
                </p><p>
                    The leads: what a trio. Joyce DiDonato. Kelli O' Hara. Renée Fleming. Italian, Irish, French names. Each with an instrument as distinct as the backgrounds their names suggest; each a gem on her own. To have them together is—to use a worn phrase—a real treat. (They are cast respectively to the aforementioned roles.)
                </p><p>
                    Contemporary opera's much greater success than its symphonic or solo counterparts may be thanks to its narrative nature: the music can only be so atonal, the plot so convoluted, the language so complex. (Libretti can be, but rarely are (and even more rarely succeed as) poetry.) <span style="font-style: italic;">The Hours</span> pushes these aspects to its limits: the music is textural, expressive; the storyline fragments and swirls; the language dissolves to words and syllables.
                </p><p>
                    And yet, it is overwhelmingly powerful. The opening scene—the chorus, serving as Virginia Woolf's dream-imagination, sing-chants the words which coalesce into the first sentence of <span style="font-style: italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>: "Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself." It's as beautiful as the line is understated—all the more so, as the sentence evaporates when Virginia Woolf wakes up: your correspondent has never felt the sensation of forgetting something from a dream so viscerally reproduced.
                </p><p>
                    The music also evaporates, and often: music for texture or atmosphere, rather than melody or narrative. Sometimes, the approach doesn't work out: not all of the opera is fragmentary dream-scapes, after all. But for the vast majority, it does: whether conjuring nostalgia, or romantic tension, or suburban <span style="font-style: italic;">weltschmerz</span>, the music—with sweeping strings or plinked tones on the piano—is uncannily effective.
                </p><p>
                    The supporting cast stand out as among the best your correspondent has seen. Some are the main characters' spouses and relations; others have but one scene. But each one shines with an inner light; the performance would be, if not lessened, changed should any of them depart.
                </p><p>
                    As it would, of course, if any of Mss. O' Hara, Fleming, or DiDonato left. Ms. O' Hara was soaring and full-bodied, but a touch strained. Ms. Fleming's was the most technically accomplished performance, but she seemed to struggle with filling the admittedly cavernous hall. Ms. DiDonato—well, she was more or less perfect.
                </p><p>
                    In the final scene of the opera, the three main characters come together in some no-space where they can perceive each other. They sing of their struggles, their constrictions, and their determination to overcome—or at least survive—them. As each sings, a lifetime of suffering and quiet triumph pours out; the music seems to tap into something cosmic. Your correspondent would be hard-pressed to identify a better ending, or more beautiful moment, in any opera.

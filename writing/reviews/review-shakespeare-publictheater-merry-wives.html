                    The Summer of Our Content: Merry Wives in Central Park
                </p><p>
	                The Public Theater's "Shakespeare in the Park" staged <span style='font-style: italic;'>Merry
                    Wives</span>—adapted from <span style='font-style: italic;'>The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>—for
                    its return from a two-year hiatus. Since its last season, America has seen an impeachment, a pandemic, the
                    Black Lives Matter protests, and the most contentious presidential election in modern history. It fell to
                    adapter Jocelyn Bioh and director Saheem Ali to respond to this moment with theater that excited deprived
                    show-goers, reunified a polarized citizenry, and welcomed people of all backgrounds. Their answer: a 
                    <a href="https://www.slantmagazine.com/theater/saheem-ali-interview-merry-wives-shakespeare-in-the-park/">"raucous comedy"</a>
                    which, after the "year and a half that everyone had been through," emphasized the
                    "joy and vitality" of everyday life. Grounding that vision are the values of openness and
                    accessibility—openness to actors of color, and accessibility to all attendees, especially people like
                    Bioh's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/theater/merry-wives-shakespeare-in-the-park.html">"Ghanaian
                    aunties and uncles,"</a> to whom Shakespeare can be "alienating." But in aspiring to
                    cultural ecumenism, the play too frequently leaned on empty gestures and rhetoric.
                </p><p>
	                The casting and acting usually succeeded in conveying the joyful and vibrant lives of South Harlem,
                    but occasionally felt uneven or superficial. The all-black cast was beflecked with diverse accents and
                    clothes; African-Americans, like the buffoonish Falstaff, and immigrants from Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal,
                    and elsewhere live beside one another. Falstaff's untied sneakers and rumpled T-shirts contrast with
                    Madam Ford's vibrant Nigerian dresses and Madam Page's flowing Ghanaian pants, heightening the
                    preposterousness of his scheme to trick them into falling for him. Yet the portrayal of other
                    characters felt clumsy, particularly the well-off, Senegalese Dr. Caius. In the original, he is
                    French—the subject of jokes and exclusion. Now, the parody is milder: his accent and dress aren't
                    caricatured. But the French phrases persist, as do overwrought gestures like cheek- and hand-kisses.
                    Stereotypes endure—they're just now directed to the wealthy and Francophone. And Fenton's casting as
                    a woman and Dr. Caius's delight at his male match pointed to a break with Shakespeare's heteronormative
                    mold, but felt shallow at best and discomfiting at worst: no one minds that one marries gay—only that
                    one doesn't marry poor.
                </p><p>
	                The location and set represented some of the play's greatest strengths: it showcased the vitality of
                    Harlem life and expanded how theatergoers might conceive Shakespeare, but sometimes relied on gags to
                    achieve their effect. The entire play takes place on a Harlem street featuring a braiding salon,
                    laundromat, and walk-in clinic—commonplace establishments which Harlemites would be pleased to see 
                    honored onstage. (Though "Windsor" was excised from the title, a building on-set bears its name—a
                    flourish typical of Harlem residences.) But one could do without the CitiBike and manhole. Both were
                    used just once, and a bike trundling across-stage and a person popping from an underground hole have
                    the virtue of amusing children and little else.
                </p><p>
	                By its end, this show, with its many changes—some Covid-induced, others deliberate—delivers on its
                    promised accessibility, but with perhaps too much hollow theatricality. Before the play, a drummer
                    leads the audience in a call-and-response in unidentified African languages. Generously speaking,
                    it's a crowd-exciting moment, but frankly evokes superficial "cultural immersions" with souvenirs
                    of masks or leis. And halfway through, Falstaff breaks character to talk about his "boredom" and
                    "Netflix bingeing" during the pandemic—a privileged and meaningless prattle that adds little to
                    the play while baldly playing to the audience. Even if the Latin lessons and the "master" and
                    "mistress" are cut, <span style='font-style: italic;'>Merry Wives</span> does both too little
                    and too much to be the broadly welcoming act it wants to be. It's joyful and appealing,
                    sure—but not much of anything else.

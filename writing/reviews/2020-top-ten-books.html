                    Top 10 Books of 2020
                </p><p>
                    This was an interesting year for your correspondent, who took advantage of a low-demand internship
                    and interminable summer days to burn through 30 books in six months, only to be knocked flat on his
                    back by the fall semester, during which he only read one book and fell irrecoverably behind on
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">The New Yorker</span>. In an unrelated way, this is a tough year
                    because choosing a top 10 list poses some challenges when many of the books are just so good.
                    But here we are: the top 10 books of 2020.
                </p><p>
                    10. <span style="font-style: italic;">Les Misérables</span> by Victor Hugo and
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">The Bonfire of the Vanities</span> by Tom Wolfe.
                </p><p>
                    Two marvelous period pieces. Both authors use the full extent of their wit, their humanity, and
                    their love for their cities to craft tales at indelibly once of their times and profoundly timeless.
                    For who cannot empathize with Larry Kramer’s hatred of the dull and dingy, or with Cosette’s loneliness
                    and suffering? Who does not bite their nails as Javert corners Jean Valjean, and who does not, audibly
                    or inaudibly, try to pronounce "Shuh-mun?" Both authors could have benefitted from some thoughtful
                    trimming, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bonfire</span> ends with a rather disappointing epilogue that your correspondent dearly hopes
                    was thrust upon the author by his editor. But none may fault these novels for being anything less than
                    supreme entertainments, and none will be disappointed to have encountered either tale.
                </p><p>
                    9. <span style="font-style: italic;">[Honeybees and Thunder]</span> by Riku Onda.
                </p><p>
                    Your correspondent hesitates to list books unavailable in English translation [2023 update: <a href="../more/index.html">working on it!</a>], but this sprawling
                    narrative of an international piano competition is far too excellent to be excluded. Ms. Onda’s novel
                    is available only in Japanese and Korean, and she
                    writes in the foreword that she hopes music may be a soothing balm that heals fractious international
                    relations, especially between Japan and Korea, adding her particular admiration of Cho Seong-Jin,
                    South Korean prodigy and first-place winner of the International Chopin Competition. Heartwarming
                    diplomacy aside, this novel may be the greatest tribute to one’s love for music your correspondent has
                    ever read. Rich descriptions of pieces from Bach to world premieres; extended discussion of the
                    meaning and purpose of art; a whole chapter framing the Liszt sonata as a tale of heroes and
                    kingdoms—this novel has it all. An absolute must for any lover of music, especially keyboard music,
                    as soon as it’s released in English.
                </p><p>
                    8. <span style="font-style: italic;">Evicted</span> by Matthew Desmond.
                </p><p>
                    This book brings both sophisticated sociological research and heartbreaking first-hand accounts
                    of renting near or below the poverty line to illustrate America’s vast income inequality. Each of
                    the book’s two techniques buttress the other; together, they add to a violent indictment more
                    forceful and more moving than the sum of its parts. Alarming statistics—the median Milwaukee
                    renter spends 60 percent of their net income on rent—and tragic scenes—a woman being evicted
                    from her trailer by her nephew—remain indelibly in one’s memory; just as vivid are the absurdities,
                    from landlords earning more than all their tenants combined to a woman spending a month’s worth of
                    food stamps on a lobster dinner. Desmond weaves years of his life into a book which is not to be
                    missed by any who seek a literary, economic, and moral dissection of America’s greatest economic fallacy.
                </p><p>
                    7. <span style="font-style: italic;">Oblivion</span> by David Foster Wallace.
                </p><p>
                    Wallace’s collection of short stories is utterly fabulous. From flash fiction that reads like poetry
                    in “Incarnations of Burned Children” to tantalizing yet unmentioned tragedy in “The Suffering Channel,”
                    every story is charged with humanity and pathos. Naturally, a short story collection has better and
                    worse stories: for example, the conceit of “Mister Squishy” is clever enough, and Wallace’s writing is
                    hypnotizing as always, but the story feels too clever in a way that even the most discursive sections of <span style="font-style: italic;">Infinite
                    Jest</span> avoid. Wallace is said to have committed suicide in large part because he no longer felt himself
                    capable of writing good fiction; your correspondent plans to read <span style="font-style: italic;">The Pale King</span>
                    next year, but <span style="font-style: italic;">Oblivion</span> negates its authors pessimism: it is nothing
                    if not fiction of the truest, most beautiful sort. 
                </p><p>
                    6. <span style="font-style: italic;">Invisible Man</span> by Ralph Ellison.
                </p><p>
                    Ellison’s only completed novel is a marvel of composition. Its bitterness permeates every page,
                    its allusions reach from the start of the narrative to the end and back again, its symbolism rewards
                    the sensitive and intelligent reader. It is not an easy novel, nor is it consistently good—some scenes
                    felt unduly extended; some transitions reach for transcendence but seem merely implausible—but its
                    good overwhelm its mediocre. Your correspondent’s girlfriend commented that, despite having last
                    read it six years past, numerous scenes remain extremely clear, and therefore extremely painful,
                    in her memory. It is a good characterization of Ellison’s greatest strength: conjuring scenes
                    that are larger than life to tackle a uniquely American rot, a rot at once larger than life and
                    no larger than one life.
                </p><p>
                    5. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Fate of Africa</span> by Martin Meredith.
                </p><p>
                    To endeavor to write a history of postcolonial Africa is nearly an impossible task. Meredith
                    conquers the task with grace and thoroughness: proceeding roughly temporally, each era’s events
                    are depicted in parallel, from many nations’ roughly concurrent independence to their collective
                    slide into despotism and lurching toward the new millennium. The history is bleak, and the elites’
                    abuse outrageous; it is truly saddening how quickly freedom fighters like Nkrumah and Houphouet-Boigny
                    become dictators and murderers. What is our duty as bystanders in the face of Rwanda, and Ethiopia,
                    and Darfur? How ought one balance national sovereignty and human dignity? The book gives no answer,
                    but lays out the evidence and history brilliantly and coherently.
                </p><p>
                    4. <span style="font-style: italic;">Absalom, Absalom!</span> by William Faulkner.
                </p><p>
                    Faulkner is known for his difficult writing, and, indeed, this novel is challenging. But it is also
                    deeply rewarding, and exceedingly enjoyable: the telling and re-telling of the Sutpen family’s history,
                    of its tragedies and depravities, of its heroes and villains, produce a narrative that is utterly
                    compelling and deeply unsettling. 
                </p><p>
                    3. <span style="font-style: italic;">Giovanni's Room</span> by James Baldwin.
                </p><p>
                    A hallucinatory, beautiful novel. Your correspondent inhaled it over the course of a single evening,
                    and found not one word that wasn’t exactly where it needed to be. David’s hatred and self-hatred,
                    Giovanni’s affection and sarcasm, and the tragedy beflecking their lives was so heavy and so
                    heartbreaking as to be physically felt. It’s a romance gone terribly wrong, but beyond its
                    characters, it has a sense of space and constriction, of light and darkness, unlike nearly
                    anything your correspondent has read before. It’s approached only by <span style="font-style: italic;">Heart of Darkness</span> and
                    surpassed only by <span style="font-style: italic;">Blood Meridian</span> (which accounts for
                    the ranking). As you read, have a cognac sec—you might just taste, in the drink, the novel’s
                    sweetness, and its underlying poison.
                </p><p>
                    2. <span style="font-style: italic;">Normal People</span> by Sally Rooney.
                </p><p>
                    Rooney’s novel—her second, and second in two years—is more or less perfect. Go read it.
                </p><p>
                    1. <span style="font-style: italic;">Blood Meridian</span> by Cormac McCarthy.
                </p><p>
                    This novel is possibly the starkest, most violent, most vivid work of the last century.
                    Harold Bloom called it “clearly the major esthetic achievement of any living American writer,”
                    and this rings true. The imagery and effect of its prose is indescribable; McCarthy puts into
                    words the terror of a lightning storm, the beauty of a forsaken landscape, and the sublimity
                    and horror of life itself.
                </p>

                    Bonus <> a book not worth reading: <span style="font-style: italic;">A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</span> by Dave Eggers.
                </p><p>
                    When former head book reviewer of the New York Times Michiko Kakutani writes that a book heralds
                    the arrival of a “talented—yes, staggeringly talented new writer,” one feels almost obliged to
                    give it a read. But your correspondent found the writing self-indulgent, incoherent, and
                    digressive in a gimmicky, rather than an intellectual, way—it is personal history, practical
                    joke, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Infinite Jest</span> rolled into one. Random drawings
                    of staplers, a fifty-page prologue with such cute gestures as a list of themes and instructions
                    for enjoyment, wear one down before some 120 pages of witty but ultimately unsatisfying reminiscences
                    appear. Thereafter, the book goes to pieces. Mr. Eggers does have a talent for memorable
                    imagery—podules of cancer in his mother’s body, exposed during surgery, are described as “cit[ies …]
                    each with an unruly, sprawling, environmentally careless citizenry with no zoning laws whatsoever”—but
                    short moments like these, and disappointment, are all that will be remembered of this book.

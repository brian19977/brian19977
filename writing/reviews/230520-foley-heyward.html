                    Concert Dispatch: Xavier Foley and Jonathon Heyward with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, 20 May 2023
                </p><p>
                    Diversity <span style="font-style: italic;">qua</span> diversity has always been a tough sell to your correspondent, who looks askance at nebulous notions like "inherent value"
                    and "intrinsic good," at least in artistic arenas. But a recent night's visit to the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, led by its incoming
                    director, Jonathon Heyward, with a first half featuring perhaps the most fun concerto your correspondent has ever heard, was the most
                    ringing affirmation of the expanding "classical" canon in recent memory.
                </p><p>
                    Before said concerto was a twelve-minute quasi-tone poem by Grace-Evangeline Mason composed for the Royal Albert Hall's one hundred fiftieth anniversary. These pieces which
                    grace the openings of many a concert come off as, even when not meant to, as overtures to the concert proper, inserted for "diversity" or as the prize of some composition
                    competition. But the work, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Imagined Forest</span>, was remarkable for what it achieved: an atmosphere ethereal and somehow deeply moving,
                    through a music characterized by expressivity transcending form, genre, and structure.
                </p><p>
                    The piece opened with an exposition of string quartet-like passages with the entire string ensemble humming below, for an effect both intimate and lush. Winds followed,
                    sparkling with chromatic color; the effect to mind crepuscular birdsong, Messian-esque, incomprehensible but instinctively benevolent. The entire experience felt akin to
                    looking out upon the land through dense fog: the angles of the scenery were never clear, but there was a surreal, atmospheric beauty which impressed in a way a sharply
                    delineated landscape never could.
                </p><p>
                    The program notes of Xavier Foley's "Soul Bass" concerto mentioned its diverse influences, Mr. Foley's virtuosity and the work's as-yet-incomplete evolution (Mr. Heyward
                    has aided Mr. Foley in drafting and revising the work since its world premiere in Atlanta in 2022). But all that can be said about the work is: wow. Its structure—a
                    three-movement concerto of a prelude, chorus, and fugue—seems to pay homage to Bach's great organ works (often a prelude-adagio-fugue) as well as César Franck's expansive
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Prélude, Chorale, et Fugue</span>. But where these pieces are studied, reverent, and hymnal, "Soul Bass," as played by its creator, is
                    humane, ecstatic, and gloriously alive.
                </p><p>
                    The Prelude opened with a lyrical, almost Romantic flourish which sidestepped (dare one say cha-cha-ed?) into the exposition proper, double-bass with pizzicato strings,
                    triangle, and maracas. The whole first movement was a natural, fluid dialogue between the double bass and the orchestra. The cadenza was electric, shockingly good; Mr.
                    Foley's easy virtuosity was on full display as his fingers wandered the uncharted regions of the bottom of the fingerboard, making sounds so gentle your correspondent
                    thought he was hearing a viola.
                </p><p>
                    The Chorus wasn't a chorale—it was a chorus: much more down to earth, celebrating life as much as creation. Patient and discursively eloquent, it conjured the felt simple
                    songs which are the gems of the soul genre. While it occasionally and convincingly rose to ecstasy, its long, great unspoolings of melody captured the heart and imagination.
                </p><p>
                    The Fugue's theme was acidic, tense, almost menacing; the movement opened with Mr. Foley's growling bass before being joined by the flutes, bassoons (as far as your
                    correspondent could tell), and strings in succession. The counterpoint was stunningly textured with Latin and gospel and of course classical ideas and harmonies. A
                    second theme, gently heralid emerged—and then joined the first in the most remarkable way: the two themes joined together, the chromatic segments of the second theme
                    slotting into the agogic, tense notes comprising the first—a double fugue of melodic, rather than contrapuntal fusion, utterly astounding and beautiful and yearning. 
                </p><p>
                    The piece turned and turned, with the bass of the orchestra working especially hard—repeated Bartók pizzicati (when the strings are plucked so hard they hit the
                    fingerboard, adding a wooden, dead percussiveness) amidst the swells of the rest of the strings. A dramatic passage soaring up—and then nothing but Mr. Foley's
                    own Bartók pizz, fortissimo and unambiguous: the musical equivalent of the period at the end of the Ithaca chapter in Ulysses, "a black dot big enough to hide a
                    flea behind." It's a strong contender for the best last note of any piece, ever.
                </p><p>
                    Mr. Foley was kind enough to give an encore, the prelude of Bach's Cello Suite in G Major. Here, it served just was well as an epilogue, a digestif rather than an
                    amuse-bouche.
                </p><p>
                    The second half proceeded as any decent performance of Tchaikovsky's greatest work would: a first movement at turns passionate, despairing, and warmly luminous; a
                    second movement elegant but not too serious; a third movement with all the requisite triumph; and a finale grief-soaked and irredeemable. Mr. Heyward did not craft
                    a particularly dynamic interpretation of this masterpiece, but the thing about masterpieces is that they're more than excellent as is.
                </p><p>
                    One note about the evening: in perhaps the final thirty seconds of the piece, one of the most incomprehensibly beautiful and, importantly, <span style="font-style: italic;">quiet</span>
                    finales in the symphonic literature, one woman felt moved to walk out of the hall, clicking heels and all. Your correspondent is incapable of imagining what sort of
                    situation demanded that she leave without waiting another thirty seconds—he would rather defecate or expire in his seat than ruin a concert for two thousand people.
                    May she never attend a concert again.

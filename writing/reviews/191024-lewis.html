                    Concert Review: Paul Lewis, 16 May 2019
                </p><p>
                    Certain names carry with them an immediate air of importance, or at least provocation: hear
                    “Garrick Ohlsson” or “Wilhelm Korstick” and one is inclined to turn the head. “Paul Lewis”
                    is not such a name; Mr. Lewis very well could be a carpenter, an accountant, or an airplane
                    pilot. He is none of the three, at least not professionally: rather, he is a world-class
                    interpreter of Beethoven and Schubert, already having completed a cycle of Beethoven sonatas
                    and recorded most of Schubert’s late solo keyboard works. This evening, he graced the intimate
                    Kaufmann Hall of the 92nd St. Y with a sonata by Haydn; the Three Intermezzi, opus 117, by Brahms;
                    and Beethoven’s colossal Diabelli Variations. Though the program is one of your correspondent's favorites this season,
                    oversights—interpretive, technical, and performative—led to an ultimately lackluster and even
                    displeasing evening.
                </p><p>
                    The opening sonata was finely performed: rapid arpeggiated sequences were deftly executed;
                    dramatic pauses were liberally extended; long melodic lines were sustained to evoke a singing
                    tone. The only true criticism of the piece that your correspondent can think of, in fact, is
                    that it is rather too saccharine: Haydn was writing in an era where much of the keyboard music,
                    solo or chamber, was to be performed in a domestic or at least private setting. Thus, the
                    severity of his most famous pupil’s music, such as that found in the 
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Appassionata</span> Sonata or the Eroica Variations, is
                    replaced with rather genteel melodies, predictable modulations, repetitive (if not outright
                    wearisome) passagework and transitions, and prim cadences. To place beside this piece the
                    rich, haunting Intermezzi and the witty Diabelli Variations is almost to make a mockery of Haydn.
                    And yet, your correspondent greatly enjoyed the performance; Mr. Lewis, too, seemed to
                    relax somewhat, bowing with relaxed shoulders—a pleasant change after his tense, hunched entry.
                </p><p>
                    It was during the Intermezzi that your correspondent began to wonder: who is snoring?
                    Alas, it was Mr. Lewis’s rattling, mildly phlegmy inhalations. One cannot place much
                    blame at all for those particular auditory distractions, but, soon, others began to
                    stand out also: the clicking of the left heel along to the beat, as though he were a
                    jazz ensemble’s drummer; the harsh stomping on the sustaining pedal, especially in
                    moments of excitement; and excited, heavy breathing during dense, technical passages.
                    It is written in the program that Mr. Lewis was taken on as a private pupil by the
                    piano titan Alfred Brendel; if not the music teacher, the conservatory instructor,
                    the reviewer, or the audio engineer, Mr. Brendel ought to have excised these incongruous
                    habits from him. Mr. Lewis does not by any means thrive in the persona of an eccentric
                    or a hermit; he should resist the urges or impulses to act in the manner of one.
                </p><p>
                    But, returning to the music: despite the disturbances, these were some of the most
                    lucid interpretations of late Brahms by any performer—certainly fit to stand beside
                    Mr. Brendel. The first intermezzo, in E-flat Major, is a richly layered, contrapuntal
                    masterpiece—a tone poem in miniature (a compliment which your correspondent can heartily
                    pay to all three of the Intermezzi). Brahms’s talent, frankly speaking, lay not in
                    his careful craft of melodies, but in constructing vast edifices from prosaic
                    harmonies and motives. From the simplest theme—an excerpt from the tonic scale,
                    undergirded by the tonic octave—Brahms conjures, practically spools out of thin
                    air, the most touching, lamenting lullaby.
                </p><p>
                    Your correspondent must confess that this imagery is originally Brahms’s; he
                    prefaces this intermezzo with these lines from a Scottish ballad: “Balow, my
                    babe, lie still and sleep! / It grieves me sore to see thee weep.” The baby,
                    however, seems nowhere to be seen: the poignancy of this piece more closely
                    resembles a mother long after her worst nightmare, breathing in the scent of
                    a blanket tinged with memories of her passed baby.
                </p><p>
                    The second intermezzo was
                    no less excellent: smoothly delineated arpeggios flowed beneath a theme deceptively
                    simple, but, observed in a particular lens—a different dynamic, say, or an unusual
                    articulation—that same theme seemed to transfigure itself from moody to jovial
                    to despairing. B-flat Minor is a complex, dark key—miles apart from any other
                    except perhaps its even more brooding cousin, E-flat Minor—and both Brahms and
                    Mr. Lewis took full advantage of the musical opportunities presented.
                </p></p>
                    The final intermezzo, in C-sharp Minor, contrasts between its two themes: the opening,
                    dark and menacing; and the music-box-esque, slightly mysterious, even eerie
                    second theme. Hints of the earlier Paganini Variations could be heard in the
                    latter theme; altogether, these three were a welcome change from the Haydn
                    sonata and an affirmation of Mr. Lewis’s musical sensitivity.
                </p><p>
                    Following the intermission, Mr. Lewis dove into Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations.
                    The waltz upon which it is based is a patriotic anthem by one Anton Diabelli,
                    who asked for variations from his contemporary composers. Schubert, Liszt, Czerny,
                    and Schumann all contributed one; Beethoven, however, declined to do so, but
                    instead published his—all thirty-three of them—separately, in a work he titled,
                    as noted in the manuscript, <span style="font-style: italic;">Veranderungen</span>—more “transformations” than “variations.”
                    (The first edition is titled the more widely used <span style="font-style: italic;">Variationen</span>.) If one is perfectly
                    frank, the first half needn’t have been there at all—Dame Uchida didn’t think so
                    (the Diabelli Variations comprise the entirety of her upcoming recital at Carnegie
                    Hall)—and so mastery over this set drives directly to the heart of the evening.
                    But Mr. Lewis’s performance was wayward, disorganized, and lacking in gravitas—such
                    that one might wonder how he has garnered so much respect from his recordings.
                </p><p>
                    The <span style="font-style: italic;">tema</span> (that is, the waltz by Diabelli
                    vs. a theme, which every variation has), marked <span style="font-style: italic;">allegro</span>, must have a bouncy,
                    jaunty feel—imagine the spring in the steps of children at play. The off-beat
                    emphases and syncopated bass motifs create a mood of jest; when played too fast,
                    or with excessive pedal, the spark of energy is lost. This evening, rather than
                    the merry-go-round whirring cheerily, it was malfunctioning—spinning to fast, it
                    seems about to careen off its axis. Mr. Lewis was unable to rein in the excitement
                    he seemed intent on expressing; rather than tethering the music to a consistent
                    beat, he gratuitously accelerated and decelerated, stamping both feet all the while.
                </p><p>
                    The next few variations proved to be an improvement on the theme: the first, 
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">alla Marcia</span>, was grand and stately
                    without being overbearing; in the fourth, the rising scalar theme, which riffs
                    on a tiny transitional motif from the tema, bounced from left hand to right
                    and bass register to treble in a quirky and delightful manner. But in the sixth,
                    Mr. Lewis once again lost control of the music, as his overeager trills failed to
                    keep in time with the beat, resulting in a haphazard and unstable performance.
                    Not to mention that the variation began <span style="font-style: italic;">ff</span>,
                    when the previous one ended <span style="font-style: italic;">pp</span>: Beethoven
                    enjoyed writing rhetorical flourishes or dramatic gestures into music, but one
                    wonders whether he would have enjoyed the jump-scare that Mr. Lewis gave his
                    audience. 
                </p><p>
                    Throughout much of the remainder of the performance, these interpretive—well,
                    piques, to be kind, and excesses, to be blunt, resulted in a word that keeps
                    returning to the fore of your correspondent’s mind: incongruous. Taken together,
                    these variations should add up to something greater than the sum of their parts.
                    But relatively minor details—that Mr. Lewis seemed not to care about the distinction
                    between <span style="font-style: italic;">mp, p,</span> and
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">pp</span>; or that one variation’s
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">allegro</span> became another’s
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">presto</span>; or that, for all his
                    foot-tapping, he never could seem to keep a consistent tempo within a
                    single variation—made the listening experience an arduous one.
                </p><p>
                    This even treaded the line into painful once, when Mr. Lewis thought it fitting
                    or funny to treat his audience to another jump-scare: this time, most unmusically
                    slamming base chords while trilling as hard as he could, at the start of the
                    twenty-first variation, after the twentieth ended <span style="font-style: italic;">p</span>.
                    One woman in the row in front of your correspondent covered her ears in
                    protest—granted, she was in the fourth row, but that should never be the case in
                    any performance of Beethoven. Such egregious treatment of people who wanted an
                    enjoyable evening, or, in the case of your correspondent, a top-notch performance
                    of one of his favorite pieces, borders on rude. Mr. Brendel touted the Diabelli
                    Variations as a prime example of how classical music need not be serious; indeed,
                    the thirteenth variation, with its call-and-response style, and the twentieth,
                    with its quotations from Leporello’s opening aria in <span style="font-style: italic;">Don
                    Giovanni</span>, were quite humorous. But whereas the performer might indulge in
                    some fun—a hand gesture here or a smile there—never should focus be lost; Mr.
                    Lewis’s humor strays far closer to irreverent than to tasteful.
                </p><p>
                    Mr. Lewis almost redeemed himself in the final five variations—pensive, emotionally
                    charged, superbly difficult soundscapes that demand all of a performer’s interpretive
                    prowess after forty-five minutes of already-difficult music. Some incongruities
                    peeked their heads again—rests were ignored in the twenty-ninth variation but
                    emphasized in the thirty-first; the <span style="font-style: italic;">andante</span> of the thirtieth was at least fifty
                    percent faster than the immediately preceding adagio. Nevertheless, the voicing 
                    of the contrapuntal lines in the thirtieth were supremely compelling,
                    and the chromatic flourishes in the thirty-first were excellently, and seemingly
                    effortlessly, managed. The tempo of the thirty-second variation, though, was at
                    least as fast as some of the <span style="font-style: italic;">presto</span>
                    variations that came before; the variation, a marvelous triple fugue whose primary
                    theme is simply ten repeated notes, had a somewhat rushed atmosphere throughout,
                    despite Mr. Lewis’s technical prowess. And the minuet of the final, thirty-third
                    variation was executed precisely, if somewhat unimpressively: an ethereal haze
                    of sound can almost be felt in the most well-done interpretations, but Mr. Lewis
                    treated this music no differently than the preceding variations, and so no eerie
                    transcendence was had. 
                </p><p>
                    The final chord of the Diabelli Variations is marked <span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>,
                    a point of some dispute among pianists. Most play it as marked—Richter, Ugorski,
                    and Pollini all do so—but, in your correspondent’s view, the more sensible minority,
                    Anderszewski fore among them, plays it <span style="font-style: italic;">p</span>,
                    hardly louder than the immediately preceding <span style="font-style: italic;">pp</span>.
                    This single note encapsulates the crux of your correspondent’s issue with Mr.
                    Lewis. While he has no qualms about deviating from the written score—a position
                    your correspondent wholeheartedly supports, since he believes that music is written
                    to be enjoyed, not microscopically examined and worshiped—the deviations were
                    inconsistently done or did not result in a better musical performance. Thus,
                    when the concert ended, your correspondent felt no need to join the standing
                    ovation nor to hear the encore, Beethoven’s bagatelle op. 126, no. 5. He finds
                    it unlikely that he will return to a concert Mr. Lewis hosts—a pity, given that
                    he cherishes his CDs of Schubert’s Wanderer Fantasy and middle-period Beethoven.
                    Never meet your heroes.

                    Theater Review: Ming Peiffer's <span style='font-style: italic;'>Usual Girls</span> by the Roundabout Theater Company
                </p>
                    Ming Peiffer crafts a bold and unwavering narrative of childhood's innocence and adulthood's indignities
                    in her new play, <span style='font-style: italic;'>Usual Girls</span>, staged by the Roundabout Theater
                    Company under the directorship of Tyne
                    Rafaeli. The play is a bildungsroman, not of a great hero, but of a young girl as she enters, explores,
                    and is beaten down by the world of reprehensible men, traitorous women, and unrelenting humiliation.
                    The play is not easy to watch; as a matter of fact, it is very, very hard. And that's a good thing:
                    the play depicts, in the barest, most unvarnished form, both the everyday embarrassments and the
                    life-changing violence that far too many people must endure. Through her portrayal of such events,
                    Peiffer compels us to wonder how we created such a monstrous society, and how we can begin to
                    undo and rebuild it.
                </p><p>
	                <span style='font-style: italic;'>Usual Girls</span> strikes with little warning. One steps
                    into a small theater bathed in bubblegum-pink
                    light. At showtime, ushers quietly close the doors, and then, without warning, the theater is
                    plunged into darkness as loud pop music blares overhead. When light returns, we are introduced
                    to Kyeoung (Midori Francis), the protagonist, and two of her friends. The play unfolds as a 
                    series of vignettes tracking the growth and maturation of Kyeoung, with each scene separated
                    from another with the same darkness and music. With each passing scene, the play takes turns
                    for the darker, and the apparently harmless encounters resurface in a much more problematic
                    light: a playground bully who threatens tattling unless he gets a kiss morphs into a partygoer
                    spreading rumors of Kyeoung's personal life; smooches to stuffed animals at a sleepover
                    become a peck on the cheek to a sexual assailant. The music between each scene offers a
                    similar experience: at first, it seems merely to startle and cover the sound of stage
                    techs; however, as the play progresses, one notices that the lyrics celebrate, with
                    profanity and slurs, all that which this play condemns.

	                A setting as innocuous as a slumber party of pre-teens can highlight the social rot
                    and perversity to which even very young children are exposed. One girl, Sasha, receives
                    the dare to drop her pajama pants and underwear; after much hesitation, she acquiesces,
                    but prefaces by saying, rapid-fire, that "I-got-my-period-last-week-and-I-get-it-if-you-don't-want-to-be-friends-anymore" 
                    before exposing, for a few very long seconds, a groin full of pubic hair. The girls (and the
                    audience) sit in stunned silence before the barrage of questions begin: when did she get
                    it, how long has it been, why did she never tell them, on and on. As it dawns on Sasha
                    that the questions are not of interrogation but of admiration, she relaxes, and then
                    revels in the attention, declaring with pride that she's also been allowed to shave her
                    legs; the other girls shriek in delight and jealousy and ask if they may pretty please
                    feel her legs. Such obsessing can appear heavy-handed, but Peiffer's skill is in
                    representing the obsession in a realistic way: your correspondent can say that the
                    girls' fascination evoked memories of boys discussing in hushed tones the intricacies
                    of sex and dating during junior- and early-high-school years. These girls' near-predatory
                    curiosity—how they mobbed poor Sasha!—is the inevitable consequence of growing up
                    alongside sex-heavy advertisements, mass media, and even dinner-table conversations
                    (whose elder siblings or parents haven't brought up dating and infidelity during a
                    meal?); this ubiquity of sex is the true target of Peiffer's criticism. Unfortunately,
                    this scene also contains the most out-of-place moment in the play: a gang of older
                    boys begin banging on a sliding-glass door, demanding that the girls expose
                    themselves; whether for their own pleasure or the girls' embarrassment isn't
                    made clear. Drawing the contrast between the girls' questioning and the boys'
                    demanding may have some merit, but by going from realism to horror (complete
                    with jump-scares), Peiffer diminishes the strength of her message and makes
                    the whole scene farcical.

                </p><p>
	                The scene after the next contains the most discomfiting, and thus the most
                    powerful, moment of the play: Peiffer uses the ritual of shaving pubic hair—at
                    once incredibly personal and bordering on mundane—to articulate her incisive
                    and poignant criticism. Kyeoung, now dressed as a young teen-ager, appears on
                    stage with shaving cream and a razor. In dialogue with her older counterpart
                    (Jennifer Lim), Kyeoung nonchalantly, and one might even say brightly,
                    describes how she is going to go about shaving herself: "'I'm going to
                    prop my foot up—' '—and you're not going to trip—' '—because if I do,
                    I'll cut off my clitoris!'" Lim's expressions of horror provide a
                    striking counterpoint to Francis's matter-of-factness; even more striking,
                    though, is Francis exposing herself to Lim (and to the audience) to be
                    shaved. The scene is almost unbearable to watch: other theatergoers had
                    averted their eyes; your correspondent could feel his insides knotting
                    up. Finally, the older Kyeoung steps back; the younger Kyeoung, still
                    nude, touches herself, and then asks, disarmingly eagerly, "Am I
                    pretty yet?" This scene exemplifies both the precision of Peiffer's 
                    writing and the skill of Francis's acting; in less adept hands, this
                    scene could have appeared overwrought or absurdist, but both conception
                    and execution were par excellence. Due to adult magazines and modern
                    pornography, shaving pubic hair has become just one more way of molding
                    ourselves closer to the "ideal form." Peiffer shows the true motivations
                    behind many a person's trim: to appear "pretty." However, by failing to
                    comment on those who are personally at ease with shaving, the play seems
                    to present an argument—that all beauty standards are constructs without
                    merit or value—that it either does not bother to or cannot thoroughly
                    support. This consideration, though problematic when considering the
                    play in its broader, sociopolitical context, thankfully does not take
                    away from the theatrical experience.

                </p><p>
	                The final moments of each scene tend to have something of a dramatic
                    flourish to them, whether that be a parent walking in on pre-teens
                    engaging in mock-intercourse with their oversized teddy bears or 
                    the aforementioned "Am I pretty yet?" Sometimes these make for
                    satisfying ends to each vignette, while at others they can feel
                    heavy-handed, even lazy. Most of the time, Peiffer manages to create
                    endings more fulfilling than not; however, the final moment of the
                    play unfortunately is also its weakest. The scene is set in a relatively
                    full subway, with the only character interaction being an incoherently
                    muttering, likely homeless man masturbating to Kyeoung. Instead of
                    furthering this encounter, the older Kyeoung (Lim), who is not present
                    in the scene, faces the audience and speaks the final line of the play:
                    "It never stops." Important as that message may be, the in-your-face
                    closing made for a hasty coda.	Despite that misstep and others of
                    varying severity along the way, Usual Girls provided both amusing
                    one-liners and unforgiving intimacy while contending with one of
                    the most ubiquitous and serious social issues of our time.

                    George Orwell wrote in <span style="font-style: italic;">1984</span>
                    that "the best books are those that tell you what you already know."
                    In that sense, <span style="font-style: italic;">Usual Girls</span>
                    is a superlative play: the ideas it presents—the
                    grotesque obsession with sex and sexuality that our society inculcates from
                    childhood, the casual abuse suffered by many high school students at the
                    hands of their peers, the debilitating burden of the female gender role—are
                    at once distinctly familiar and (in part due to that familiarity)
                    unpleasantly visceral. And it should be—for how did it become accepted,
                    and even encouraged, for one half of the population in an ostensibly
                    equal society to act agreeably rather than honestly, subserviently rather
                    than assertively, and with respect rather than with self-respect?

                </p><p>
                    The true power of Usual Girls lies in its ability to expose so brilliantly
                    the hypocrisies we all tacitly condone—with our time spent listening
                    to the misogynistic and materialistic music of so-called artists;
                    with our dollars given to fashion companies that reinforce narrow
                    beauty standards; with our votes given to officials who restrict
                    the rights, resources, and power of the already-disenfranchised.
                    But at its best, the play is as subtle as the issues it raises
                    are far-reaching: the offhand one-liners and the slump of
                    Kyeoung's shoulders can betray societal biases and the psychological
                    repercussions thereof. The play has grand ambitions, and, like
                    anything which seeks to say something about everything, it
                    inevitably falls short in some respects. But what it does say—that
                    we oughtn't be constrained by our self-image, that people can be
                    cruel for no apparent reason at all, that at day's end the person
                    who has to live with your decisions is you—makes the play a
                    splendid work of our time and heralds a bright new voice in American theater.

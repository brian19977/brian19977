                    Concert Dispatch: Yefim Bronfman and Rafael Payare with the Montréal Symphony Orchestra (OSM), 8 March 2023
                </p><p>
                    A Carnegie Hall veteran and a new orchestra director teamed up for an exciting, excellent concert of Chang,
                    Bartók, and Mahler. The evening opened with Chang's <span style="font-style: italic;">Precipice</span>, meant
                    to evoke everything from COVID to racial injustice to climate danger. It was followed by the Hungarian master's
                    Piano Concerto no. 2, one of the most finger-busting works in the repertoire, performed by Yefim Bronfman, a
                    pianist who may inspire respect more than raving but whose technique and musicality are unimpeachable. The
                    second half of the concert was dedicated to Mahler's Symphony no. 5, one of his most recognizable—from its
                    fate-motif opening to its glorious Adagietto—whose popularity has only grown thanks to its prominence in the
                    recently-released <span style="font-style: italic;">Tár</span>. Rafael Payare led his eager, nimble ensemble through this hefty evening with verve and
                    elegance. Though not every crucial moment was together, the musicians put together a splendid performance
                    that had its audience smiling on the way out; your correspondent looks forward to the group's future visits.
                </p><p>
                    Any piece of music meant to capture the world is bound either to fall short or overwhelm; Ms. Chang's
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Precipice</span> is to be lauded for its vision and present-ness
                    but does not say much about anything. Hopefully her other compositions are more likely to succeed
                    in their stated goals.
                </p><p>
                    With the Bartók concerto, the OSM had abundant opportunity to show off its brass and winds, and they did not
                    pass it up. The first movement, scored without any strings, is an exercise in balance—between jagged chords
                    from the piano, delicate melodies from the winds, and grand blasts from the brass; Payare coaxed forward the
                    easily-overwhelmed flutes and held the trombones in check, making a lovely, glossy sheen to undergird the
                    galloping piano solo. When the strings came in during the second movement, a warm, earthen mood pervaded;
                    the piano became a lyric instrument, singing in rich, dark-yellow tones the songs of Bartók's homeland. The third
                    movement was a riot from start to finish; in the cadenza before the finale, Bronfman let it all loose—from
                    the faux-hesitant start to the slam-bang (in the best sense) runs which closed out the piece. Well-earned
                    cheers and ovations convinced Mr. Bronfman to give an encore of Chopin's Nocturne in D-flat Major; it too
                    was rich, golden—just gorgeous.
                </p><p>
                    Mahler's Fifth has a peculiar structure: five movements and three parts. The first and second, both funeral
                    marches, comprise part one; the third, a horn concerto, is part two; the aforementioned Adagietto and an exuberant
                    finale make part the last. A successful performance must not only be enjoyable moment-to-moment but pull together
                    this seventy-minute, multipartite beast into a coherent whole. Mr. Payare did not quite get full marks on this challenging task, but
                    his interpretation did yield novel insights and enjoyments.
                </p><p>
                    For example, the famous opening trumpet call was performed
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">ad libitum</span>—that is, Mr. Payare declined to conduct it, the only
                    conductor your correspondent knows of who decided thus. It was an excellent choice, one which allowed the
                    trumpet to hark rather than to announce; it felt more solemn, more <span style="font-style: italic;">trauermarsch</span>. And at the end of the
                    movement, the ensemble was slowed way down; the last chord was taken as quietly as possible—also something
                    your correspondent has never heard, and something immediately and totally convincing.
                </p><p>
                    The muscular second movement led into the third, where the OSM's marvelous principal horn stole the show. Here, too,
                    Mr. Payare gave the soloist a free hand, letting her take her breaths and then expel them in arcing lines of passion
                    and warmth. In the Adagietto—taken faster than many recent interpretations, and better off for 
                    it—<span style="font-style: italic;">pianissimo</span> plucking from the basses grounded the remaining strings'
                    miraculous performance of this love song. Mr. Payare reined in the ensemble as it swelled and let it go as it
                    reached the musical climax, resulting in a tight buildup whose release was all the more explosive for it.
                </p><p>
                    The only true faults of the evening were in the last movement. The musicians, weary from a long concert; Mr. Payare,
                    still unsure of a dense, contrapuntal finale; the audience, not yet awoken from the glazed happiness of the Adagietto—all
                    factors amalgamated in a haphazard, unconvincing finale. In the last minute or so, though, with brass fanfares and soaring
                    strings, both the musicians and the audience collected themselves for the symphony's celestial end—perhaps the most humane,
                    and straightforwardly joyful, of all of Mahler's symphonies. The ovation went on and on; Mr. Payare introduced each of his
                    sections in turn. Each and every one deserved its cheer.

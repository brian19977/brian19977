                    Concert Review: Boris Giltburg, 29 November 2023
                </p><p>
                    Piano recital programs, for better or worse, follow a fairly standard structure: a brief appetizer—a Bach toccata, perhaps—followed by a standard, well-regarded sonata or
                    suite—Beethoven or Mozart's territory—for the first half; a serious, substantive Romantic work—the four Chopin ballades, for example—often occupies the second half. A
                    twentieth-century piece shows up every so often, as do longer works like the hour-long Diabelli Variations.
                </p><p>
                    This evening took the standard structure to incredible extremities: Boris Giltburg gave a recital opening with Beethoven's Sonata in A-flat Major, op. 110—a virtuosic,
                    deeply emotional work—and followed by Liszt's Sonata in B Minor—one of the most demanding in the repertoire. As if that were not enough, Rachmaninoff's thirteen Preludes,
                    op. 32—bewilderingly beautiful gems, nauseatingly difficult monsters—closed the evening.
                </p><p>
                    First seeing the program, your correspondent was so astounded that he resolved to make the hour-and-a-half journey from New York to Philadelphia to see it. Suffice to say
                    it was worth the trek: Mr. Giltburg made light work of these ferocious, intimidating works; despite a program without a moment of respite, he consistently projected
                    sensitivity, humor, and passion. The few uneven passages or inexplicable interpretations hardly detracted from an excellent evening.
                </p><p>
                    Mr. Giltburg took his time settling in; when he at last played the opening—warm and buttery, at once calming and anticipatory—a mature, elegant aesthetic immediately made
                    itself apparent. The theme proper was not just songlike, but lullaby-like: left hand chords barely audible, a gentle thrum undergirding his clear, unpretentious melody.
                    Even in the darker moments of the first movement, the music never lost this fundamentally humane character.
                </p><p>
                    The second movement, unfortunately, was more inconsistent: oddly rushed chords made for a muddy, weak sound; despite the tempo marking of "Allegro molto," it should never
                    sound hurried, but hurried it was. A quirky, bouncing middle section returned, disappointingly, to more rushing.
                </p><p>
                    The third movement—without a doubt the emotional center of the work—is notoriously hard to play well, but in Mr. Giltburg's hands, it was altogether excellent. The opening
                    recitative was appropriately grim, slate-gray if it had a color, and led into a keening arioso, melancholic without being overly slow (many subpar performances wallow in
                    the misery and lose all momentum). The first fugue was dancelike and gentle, slightly mischievous—a perfect respite for the arioso's return, this time mournful to the brink
                    of despair. Mr. Giltburg captured the "weeping" quality of the music perfectly, and the last three chords before the transition back to the fugue were never bettered. The
                    fugue itself started slow—as if shaking off the heaviness of the arioso—but soon took off. And despite weaker-than-expected chords in the finale, a masterful accelerando,
                    more than a minute long, made for a thrilling, life-affirming end.
                </p><p>
                    The Liszt sonata—Liszt's supreme achievement for the piano—is a thirty-minute, single-movement work with a Matryoshka-style structure: its single movement itself contains
                    four movements—the first movement neatly maps onto the exposition; the andante and scherzo-fugue comprise the development; and the returning allegro to the end are the
                    recapitulation and coda. Conveying a sense of this large-scale structure while dealing with the ink-splatter that is the score constitutes the sonata's main challenge;
                    Mr. Giltburg, very impressively, gave an interpretation both technically marvelous and structurally compelling.
                </p><p>
                    From the opening three notes, Mr. Giltburg's interpretation set itself apart: most performances open with sharp, unambiguous chords, but Mr. Giltburg gave them air,
                    with a touch of pedal; they sounded more like brief sighs, more apt for the winding chromatic scale they introduce. Though this nuance did not sustain itself in the
                    "first movement's" exposition, which Mr. Giltburg over-pedaled for a muddy, dull texture, the remainder of the piece felt at turns assured, demonic, and transcendent.
                    The "grandioso" theme, a noble and heroic march, processed like war heroes down a boulevard; repeated-note passages, pedal-less and near-double speed, acquired a
                    fierce, biting quality bordering on delirium. Each sparkling "dolce" was matched by stormy tremolos, highlighting both the drama of the piece as a whole and the
                    contrasting moods possible with a single theme. The piece's ending was dark but outward-looking, as if about to see the light: the three sighing notes from the
                    start became three last breaths, at peace and ready to enter the beyond.
                </p><p>
                    For your correspondent, the second half was especially anticipated, with Rachmaninoff being one of his favorite composers and Mr. Giltburg having great renown as an
                    interpreter of his works. His Rachmaninoff has been described as "relaxed, oceanic, understated at first blush but with ecstatic climaxes," and this single sentence
                    sums up the second half aptly. Gone was the rush and muddiness from the Liszt and Beethoven; in its place, colossal sonorities, tolling bells, and astonishing sensitivity.
                    For the second half alone, your correspondent would have made the journey. 
                </p><p>
                    More than anything, Mr. Giltburg brought a clarity of structure and emotion to the preludes: in his hands, even the most impetuous and contradictory preludes seemed
                    focused, even rhetorical. No. 4 in E Minor is a perfect example: perfect fifths and octaves give the sound a purgatorial, hollow quality, while the churning chords
                    between them hint at something between unease and torment. The climax of the prelude, a storm of chords in indeterminate key and mode, normally comes off as
                    cacophonous and uncontrolled; Mr. Giltburg built toward it with accelerandi and crescendi, such that, when the music reached its peak, it felt expected, even
                    inevitable: purgatorial torment rewarded with release.
                </p><p>
                    Sometimes the sense of coherence could come from subtle touches, such as remarkable pedal work in no. 2 emphasizing the theme even in dense counterpoint,
                    or fleet fingers keeping the melody in the foreground with minimal pedal in no. 8. In other cases, he marshaled every pianistic resource at his disposal to great effect:
                    in no. 13—the final prelude and by some distance the best Rachmaninoff wrote—thundering bells, shimmering filigree, and a warmly benevolent melody singing above it all
                    soared toward one brilliant arpeggio in the final bar: music in flight, and perfection in music. The whole prelude seemed exhaled in a single breath, and it was Mr.
                    Giltburg's greatest statement of his musical identity.
                </p><p>
                    After several rounds of standing ovations, Mr. Giltburg gave an encore, well suited to his strengths: Rachmaninoff's transcription of Fritz Kreisler's "Liebeslied." No
                    piece could have been more apt than this lilting song, with its gentle melody and Rachmaninoffian bravado. Its warmth nourished your correspondent all the way back to New York.

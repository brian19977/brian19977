                    Top 10 Books of 2022
                </p><p>
                    After the failures of the previous year's reading, your correspondent decided to go back to the
                    basics: those novels which are immediately delightful, humorous, and moving. Keeping close to
                    home proved a wise decision; it reminded him that for all the satisfaction of challenging,
                    thoughtful works, sometimes all one really needs are those books and writers closest to one's
                    heart. Here are your correspondent's top 10 books of 2022.
                </p><p>
                    10. <span style="font-style: italic;">To Paradise</span> by Hanya Yanagihara.
                </p><p>
                    Your correspondent was pleased with the attention Hanya Yanagihara—the author of
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">A Little Life</span><sup>[<a id="en1src" href="#en1">1</a>]</sup>,
                    one of his favorite books—received with the publication of <span style="font-style: italic;">To Paradise</span>:
                    a profile in <span style="font-style: italic;">The New Yorker</span>, stacks of signed hardcovers
                    in every bookstore visited, banner ads and at least one subway poster. He was less pleased with the book
                    itself: written in her same vivid, tactile prose—he's never loved the word "buttery" so much—but misshapen,
                    uneven, and unsatisfying as a novel. The volume made the list at all almost exclusively on the merit of
                    its sheer writing quality. It has a navel-gazing sensibility that begins as cleverly abrasive and finishes
                    as abrasive; your correspondent cannot in all honesty endorse the book.
                </p><p>
                    9. <span style="font-style: italic;">World Order</span> by Henry Kissinger.
                </p><p>
                    Henry Kissinger weaves a compelling, well-argued narrative of the two arms which balance world order: power
                    and legitimacy. Legitimacy without power is useless; power without legitimacy is a death sentence. The
                    sources of legitimacy, and their impact on the gain, wielding, and loss of power were Kissinger's biggest
                    contributions; no book, let alone one coming in at just about 350 pages, can explain perfectly all the cogs
                    behind the rise and fall of empires—but Kissinger's comes close.
                </p><p>
                    8. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Twenty-Seventh City</span> by Jonathan Franzen.
                </p><p>
                    Jonathan Franzen's debut novel was well-received critically but sold poorly, and it's not a big wonder
                    why: it's moralistic, unhumorous (or rather anti-humorous), serious, a little unapproachable—an uptight
                    Midwesterner of a book. But it also has, fully-formed, the best qualities of Franzen's writing: sympathetic,
                    human characters; perfectly tuned dialogue, in hostility and in seduction; descriptions of everyday
                    occurrences and objects that come to mind the next time you yourself encounter them. Its legacy may be
                    as the first book of a writer better known for his later works, but it is still an admirable work in
                    its own right.
                </p><p>
                    7. <span style="font-style: italic;">[Human Acts] </span>by Han Kang.
                </p><p>
                    Han's most tragic novel by far, <span style="font-style: italic;">Human Acts</span> ("The Boy Comes" in Korean, the language in which your
                    correspondent read the book) concerns the Gwangju Demonstration of 1980, whose casualties include three
                    thousand massacred and thousands more detained, tortured, raped, and otherwise abused by government
                    troops and authorities. The vileness of the murders, the trauma of survival, the pain to bear
                    witness—<span style="font-style: italic;">Human Acts</span> captures and stares down all of it
                    in lucid, cold prose. 
                </p><p>
                    6. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Book of Salt </span>by Monique Truong.
                </p><p>
                    Contemporary American fiction's maximalism—DeLillo's <span style="font-style: italic;">Underworld</span> and
                    Wallace's <span style="font-style: italic;">Infinite Jest</span>, for two canonical examples—is distilled
                    into under 300 pages, spiced with the immigrant experience, and garnished with Gertrude Stein and Alice Toklas
                    in Monique Truong's fantastic debut novel. Its prose is as lush, rich, and suffocating as your correspondent
                    imagines the Vietnamese humidity to be; there is something to its sheer density that precludes extended reading,
                    which comes off as a weakness. But that same density is crucial to the lushness and richness that makes the
                    work so good: the extended food metaphors, the domestic life of Stein and Toklas, the tragedy beflecking every
                    character in the book. It is a work felt primarily in the gut—and that is intended most highly. 
                </p><p>
                    5. <span style="font-style: italic;">Brief Interviews with Hideous Men </span>by David Foster Wallace.
                </p><p>
                    David Foster Wallace's three novels are each so <span style="font-style: italic;">sui generis</span> that someone who loves one may well brush aside
                    another. His short stories offer a greater consistency as to their quality: absolutely fantastic. The
                    "interviews" themselves carry on <span style="font-style: italic;">Infinite Jest's</span> narrative
                    style—questions replaced by "Q"—and overall atmosphere—darkly humorous and humorously dark. The other
                    short stories inspire laughter, groaning, and more than a few sighs and "Oh my God"s; in particular,
                    "Adult World I" and "Adult World II," "Forever Overhead," and "Church Not Made With Hands" are dyed
                    with the same wit, gentleness, and subtlety that made your correspondent fall in love with Wallace
                    in the first place. He may break the upcoming year's resolution not to buy new books to tackle the
                    first two books by this astounding writer.
                </p><p>
                    4. <span style="font-style: italic;">On Such a Full Sea</span> by Chang-Rae Lee.
                </p><p>
                    Your correspondent's partner bought this book for him after reading it for class (as with the immediately
                    preceding entry), and though he found the start of the novel challenging to get into, it ended up ranking
                    quite high on this year's list. Why? Answering this question, he must begin with the narration: omniscient
                    first-person plural—an unidentified group watching the protagonist along her journey to find her beloved,
                    taken away for unknown experiments after being found to be immune to "C." The tone is admiring, elegiac,
                    tender; your correspondent's partner compared it to the chorus in a Greek tragedy. And tragic it is: one
                    mourns the world it draws and the people who inhabit its barren, scarred lands. And amidst its apocalyptic
                    setting, the book also captures better than any other book the duty of filial piety felt by Asian children.
                    Probably the most touching books of the year.
                </p><p>
                    3. <span style="font-style: italic;">Blindness </span>by Jose Saramago.
                </p><p>
                    The prize motivation of Jose Saramago's Nobel Prize declared that he, "with parables sustained by imagination,
                    compassion, and irony, continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory reality." This rings true of
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Blindness</span>, a far darker, more haunting <span style="font-style: italic;">Lord of the Flies.</span>
                    The prose is direct, simple (almost) to a fault; the observations are neutral, wry, at times expressed with a
                    suppressed chuckle. Its true magnificence comes from its ability to conjure beautiful moments and believe in
                    the best of people despite the world replete with evil and death within its pages. About this book more than
                    any other book on this list, your correspondent extols its human incandescence and discourages the faint of
                    heart.
                </p><p>
                    2. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet </span>by David Mitchell.
                </p><p>
                    Your correspondent adores anything David Mitchell writes, so it's curious that he reads him so
                    infrequently—<span style="font-style: italic;">Cloud Atlas</span> twice and <span style="font-style: italic;">Slade House</span>
                    once, both in high school. This brilliant novel set in Dejima—a tiny port which was the only area of Japan
                    open to Europeans for 300 years—bursts with the most eclectic characters: the titular clerk, but also a
                    daring midwife, a corrupt port administrator (redundant?), a brash American general (ditto), and a deist
                    polymath who uses an execution by guillotine as an opportunity for an anatomy lesson. These characters'
                    sometimes-farcical misadventures contrast with horrors beyond imagining on the mainland; add Mitchell's
                    ear and creativity for the most inventive dialogue of any writer alive today, and one gets nothing short
                    of an underrated masterpiece.
                </p><p>
                    1. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Goldfinch </span>by Donna Tartt.
                </p><p>
                    Your correspondent cannot think of any three-book oeuvre praised and idolized as highly as that of Donna Tartt.
                    Her debut novel was edged out in your correspondent's list for 2020 only by virtue of overwhelming competition;
                    her most recent novel is hilarious, moving, and saddening in an autumnal sort of way, often at the same time.
                    (See the fourteen-year-old protagonist saying farewell to his only friend, the son of a mining tycoon, with a
                    duffel and a dog in tow: "I stopped myself from blurting the thing on the edge of my tongue, the thing I'd
                    never said, even though it was something we both knew well enough … which was, of course, I love you.") One
                    other thing worth pointing out: as with Wallace and tennis or Melville and whaling, Tartt has the remarkable
                    ability to write such that one can read pages upon pages about a niche topic, in this case furniture and
                    restoration. Your correspondent gulped down this nearly 800-page novel in perhaps two weeks; he cannot
                    recommend it highly enough.

                    Bonus <> a book not worth reading: <span style="font-style: italic;">Lake Success</span> by Gary Shteyngart.
                </p><p>
                    One of your correspondent's favorite short stories to run in <span style="font-style: italic;">The New Yorker</span>
                    is "The Luck of Kokura," an excerpt of this novel. After all, what's not to like about a moronic financier
                    embarrassing himself while hanging out with a former employee whom he fired after a stray negative sign lost
                    their company a hundred million dollars? A great deal, it turns out, when it goes on for more than a dozen
                    pages. A plot as sagging and hapless as the protagonist—its focal point is a road trip "to experience the real
                    America," somehow even worse for being ironic than if it had been earnest—and characters as ridiculous as the
                    obscene wealth they possess make for a feeling not unlike pity for the author. Turns out that "The Luck of
                    Kokura" was better left as a short story.

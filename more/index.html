                    I have simply too many hobbies to perform any of them very admirably, but I'm pleased to
                    say that that fact's never much daunted or bothered me. I principally occupy myself with
                    music—listening, attending, and performing—and rock climbing—primarily bouldering. My other
                    pursuits include reading, biking, and trying new restaurants.

                    Music has been a part of my life since I was seven, when I began to learn the piano. The trajectory
                    of music as a hobby was launched almost singularly by the New York State Music Festival,
                    where over two successive summers I saw students my age perform in a way I only imagined professionals
                    could. Its dispensation scaffolded my interest in music long enough for my to come to truly love it.
                </p><p>
                    I have given solo piano recitals in 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022, as well as nearly one hundred performances
                    of solo and chamber music with others. My favorite composers to play are Bach, Beethoven, and Schubert.

                    There is no hobby I've fallen for so immediately and thoroughly as climbing. As a naturally unathletic
                    child, scraping along in high school thanks to my occasional biking, starting to climb felt for me much like
                    the first time I ever wore glasses: a moment of realization, "So that's what the big fuss is about."
                </p><p>
                    I began climbing in the spring of 2018. Within six months, I had sent V6; in just over a year, V8. The
                    pandemic forced me outdoors, where I pushed my grade on rock from V3 to V8 in the span of a spring
                    and summer. Today, I enthusiastically climb on rock and plastic; I am currently working on Chossuary, V9/10.

                    Though my reading volume has wavered, my ardor for (and my purchase of) books have not faltered since I learned
                    to love literature in high school. I mostly read contemporary American literature, classic Western fiction,
                    and <span style="font-style: italic;">The New Yorker</span>, to which I've subscribed since 2015.

                    Sweating, panting, and sore, I stumbled off my bike and threw my crashpad-climbing bag ensemble
                    onto the ground. I was fifteen minutes late to Worthless Boulder but my friend—I'll call him S.—was
                    nowhere in sight. He strolled up by the time I was done warming up—hanging from chest-height
                    jugs, tiptoeing to tug on some crimps, doing a few easy moves with the pad under me. Despite
                    the July heat and the masks, he seemed to be in a good mood.
                </p><p>
	                We soon got down to work on our respective projects: mine, a linkup-traverse called Terminator
                    XX; his, a Manhattan classic called Mean Green. S. had been working this problem for a few
                    months; its crux is the first move, a big throw from thin, slippery crimps
                    and poor feet to a sloper-pinch. In my eyes, he had been so close for the last few sessions that I was confused
                    how he wasn't able to hold it.
                </p><p>
	                By the end of the session—two and a half hours later, with no skin on our fingertips and sunburn
                    on our necks—I had made a little progress by linking the boulder in three parts, down from four
                    the last visit; S., on the other hand, was leaving with nothing but increased frustration. His
                    mood tends to darken as things don't go well; today, the humidity seemed only to worsen things.
                    Gone was the cheerful smile from the start of the session, replaced with muttering revolving
                    around his frustration at the boulder's putative grade: "How is this a V4?"
                </p><p style="text-align: center;">

	                Grades may be the most hotly debated aspect of climbing—which is a pity, since, because climbing
                    difficulty is immeasurable (unlike metrics like the speed of a runner) and continuous (unlike
                    discrete measurements like the number of bowling pins felled), grades tend to be inconsistent and
                    arbitrary. And there is <a href="https://www.climbing.com/people/grading-systems-are-stupid/">no</a>

                    about the contemporary over-emphasis
                    on grades. Naturally, I have an opinion about this too—but that is not the story of today.
                    Today is about the boulder grades in Manhattan—the three hundred or so distinct problems
                    that dot the island. Climbing grades may be immeasurable and continuous, and they may even
                    be arbitrary. But I believe they should never be inconsistent. Like it or not, people—myself
                    included—use grades to pick lines to project, to suggest problems to newcomers, and to puff
                    their egos on Instagram. Consistent grading is a big—the biggest—part of that.
                </p><p>
                    I'm going to end up changing—both upgrading and downgrading—grades that have stood for a long
                    time, sometimes decades before I was around. This is both sacrilegious and necessary. Holds
                    have broken, rock has worn and smoothened, and bouldering has proliferated. Please keep two
                    things in mind: (1) my aim above all is consistency (I in fact downgrade two of my own toughest
                    sends from V8 to V7), and (2) this is just my opinion, born of two years of pandemic bouldering
                    that has led to a modicum of fame in the Northeast bouldering community. (Speaking of the Northeast
                    bouldering community: I have not bouldered enough outside of Manhattan to achieve regional consistency.
                    I hope to do so in the years to come.)

                    Here are a few notes on my methods and organization before continuing:
                </p>

                    <li class="space">
                        The article is organized by area. Not every problem in an area is listed, to avoid
                        repetition with available guides. I will only mention here problems which are benchmarks
                        for their grade or are changed from their "standard" grading.
                    </li><li class="space">
                        I comment on the grades of boulders which I have not climbed; this is an act so
                        blasphemous as to be the subject of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cbz8R3_j8T7/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">
                        Jakob Schubert's 2022 April Fool's Joke.</a> I will (but have not yet had to) downgrade boulders I have not
                        sent if two conditions are met:
                        <ul class="myindent">
                            <li class="space">(1) I have projected the line for at least ten sessions</li>
                            <li class="space">(2) I have climbed a significant section of the boulder, e.g., a stand-start.</li>
                            <li class="space">
                                It's worth noting that if I were downgrading maliciously, downgrading lines would not help
                                my standing much: it would mean that instead of being unable to climb something at grade X,
                                I was unable to climb something at grade X-n, which would naturally be more "embarrassing"
                                to whatever degree. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        I will also upgrade boulders I have not climbed, with all such instances explicitly mentioned below.
                    </li><li class="space">
                        The only non-integer grades I use are X/Y, e.g., V4/5. +/- complicate the grading—Is V4+ harder than V4/5?
                        Easier? Is it the hardest V4 in the world without being a V5?—and the last point in the previous parenthetical
                        shows that +/- is more often used to preserve an outmoded number than to inform the climber.

                    Rat and Cat Rocks are the oldest modern bouldering areas in Manhattan. Falacci's  first-person
                    history on <a href="http://beta-boy.com/nycboulderingguide/">beta-boy.com</a> is an invaluable
                    resource on the first days of bouldering in the best urban climbing scene in the country. These
                    grades were long sandbagged (though perhaps not as sandbagged as the aggressive new wave that
                    took over Worthless Boulder), but they have by and large stood the test of time.

                        Long considered the hardest V0 in the city, the problem has long been used by
                        seasoned outdoor climbers to humble strong gym climbers. I am upgrading here
                        to abolish the use of this problem in the manner described. Its notoriety
                        arises from its exceeding difficulty only in areas which gym climbers are
                        untrained (slippery/invisible feet, subtle ripples in rock in lieu of
                        obvious hands). In all other matters, it is quite straightforward.

                        This one-move V2 used to be thought a V3, equivalent to its sit-start sibling.
                        Though I have no inherent problems with sit- and stand-starts having the same
                        grade, this move simply does not warrant V3.

                        Long the hardest problem at Rat Rock, Testpiece in its current incarnation—all
                        face holds on, left rail off for hands and feet, exiting between the rail and
                        the flake—challenges both the fingers and the minds of strong climbers.

                        A worthwhile eliminate, using all holds except the prominent tooth
                        feature and finishing as Rat Patrol. Described as such for the first time by
                        Dan Katz.

                        latter reverses Polish Traverse. In any case, both are significantly easier
                        than the V6 trifecta given below.

                        Graded at V3 before crucial holds broke, V5 is far more appropriate for this stiff,
                        height-dependent line.

                        trifecta of one-move wonders on the West Face. All beta- and finger-strength dependent,
                        they stand as some of the toughest, most frustrating problems in Manhattan.

                        Koma's Roof Stand, which made no sense, given that one began sitting. This starts with the
                        right hand on a bad sloper below the sloping rail. Called a V8 by Falacci, I (regretfully)
                        agree with consensus arriving at V7.

                        Leah only writes to avoid the golf-ball and grades it at V6; Falacci writes to avoid both
                        the golf-ball and the sloper-pinch below and to the right of the golf-ball and grades it
                        at V7. The latter both makes more sense as a line and proposes a more significant
                        challenge; I go with the latter here. (I happen to have made the first publicly

                    Worthless is my home crag—a twenty-minute walk from school; I would go two or three
                    times a week in good weather. I've climbed everything I can on the boulder, and
                    have projected many of the harder problems (with mixed success). Worthless has
                    some of the most inconsistent grading, both compared to other lines on the
                    boulder and to the city. This hopefully fixes that.

                        Falacci calls this V4, which, given that his guide also calls Mean Green V4,
                        is untenable. Any climber above V3 will be able to attest to this.

                        This was called a V5 for the longest time as well, which given how large Polish
                        Traverse looms in Manhattan bouldering, is shocking. It is significantly easier
                        than Mean Green.

                        This upgrade is a long time coming. From the extremely slippery starting hands
                        and feet to the insecure sloper and sharp crimps, it is a challenging line that
                        will be sure to fend off strong gym and outdoor climbers alike.

                        calls this problem V6, though he himself acknowledges it may be easier than its

                    as "not soft," and Valenzuela has affirmed the grade.
